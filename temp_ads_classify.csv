We all have a role to play in reconciliation and our everyday actions matter. We want to build a future where the voices of children just like these little ones are heard, valued and amplified. 

Here are a few tangible ways you can #BeAVoice for #Reconciliation for the next generation:

✨ Be a voice for listening: Protect the space for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices to be heard.

✨ Be a voice for representation: Learn about the history of representative bodies and calls for treaty. Listen to the calls, debates and discussions by First Peoples on treaties, constitutional reform, and Voice to Parliament. 

✨ Be a voice for unity: Connect with your local Traditional Custodians, amplify their voices and collaborate with local reconciliation groups.

✨ Be a voice for learning: Speak up to ensure that our children learn about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and history in schools.

Ben discusses how the unions in NSW that have been racking up wins across education, healthcare, transport as part of the campaign and the flow on effects for working people across the state.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

The Robodebt Royal Commission has wrapped up and despite Insiders discussing the cultural problems of the public service without mentioning that culture flows from the top, Morrison, Tudge, Porter, Stuart Robert, Ben discusses what the lack of billionaire owned media coverage says about the state of public discourse.

The RBA and Productivity Commission continue to kick working people.  Ben makes clear that Labor government's need to intervene to support working people.  That a former Liberal staffer running the Productivity Commission is unacceptable and that the RBA continues to use a broken ideology rather than economic reality to set monetary policy.

Ben reminds listeners that the FINAL Week on Wednesday LIVE at Adelaide Fringe is on THIS WEEK and the special guest will be Kyam Maher, Attorney General, Industrial Relations Minister and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who passed the first Voice to Parliament in Australia. tickets here: https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023

These are the 23 candidates running for the 10 spots on council. Their pictures and profiles have only just been published on the Electoral Commission SA website. 👇

👤Sam Shetler
Evanston South's Sam Shetler said council can be a vehicle for change. The society and environment teacher is no stranger to local government, having taken an interest in the sector through his role in grassroots advocacy. Growing up in poverty in the US before shifting to Gawler, Mr Shetler was a founding member of Anti-Poverty Network SA. In 2019 he addressed council for its support in backing a raise to the Newstart allowance. His advocacy has continued, most recently speaking to council on a petition he created for improvements to the Gawler Skatepark. Mr Shetler said two of his key focus areas, if elected, would be increasing community participation in council matters and addressing the cost of living through council-led initiatives. This is a paraphrase of the news article 'Shetler to Stand for Council' published in The Bunyip on the 8th of June 2022. If you'd like to know more about me, you can ring me on 0421 944 452.

I'm proud to call Gawler home. I'm equally proud to have been chosen to be your elected member in the 2018 elections. I define an elected member as one that is contactable, that listens, and moves to get the best outcomes for our town. I have always voiced the logic that I believe is expected on the items the chamber addresses. I admit, I haven't always been successful at getting that logic agreed to, but I have been consistent whilst learning a lot. I am proud of my achievements to date; however, there is still work to do. I believe our council needs to ensure the fundamental service levels align with ratepayer expectations whilst also improving on community engagement. I'm a 33-year-old husband, father, building project manager and 2018 -2022 councillor. I'm hoping to get my community's support once again to be their voice. For those who follow council business you know my loyalties have always been with our community. Go to nathanshanks.com.au to find out more. Our vote! Our town!

Having owned and operated the Table Top Warfare business in Gawler for the last 6 years has made myself, my partner Alicia and our 3 young boys fall in love with all that Gawler has to offer. I am keen to help drive the success of all businesses within Gawler and feel I could be a positive voice to help local business owners achieve their goals and assist to resolve any issues preventing success. Contribution and active participation in the community has always been an integral part of my time in the Gawler area. I feel I would be well positioned to continue that contribution further if elected to Council. Social inclusion is also something I am really passionate about. I feel there should be more funding and better opportunities for people with special needs, social minority groups, social clubs and youth in the area. Being my first time running for council, I would love the opportunity to make a difference and have a positive impact on the wider Gawler community. www.waynefischer.com

I support and advocate for initiatives that enrich our community and that boost our local economy. i believe that we can protect our treasured heritage while also embracing good development.

I have been raised in Gawler since 1987 and 20yrs of those have been as a rate payer. I would by now like to consider myself and family locals, although this has seen me at times come in and out of the area, Gawler has always been the place I refer to as home. I strive to be open and honest with the community to assist the council in important decisions that will see happier future generations thrive in this community. What Im passionate about is youth and general employment, traffic congestion and safer roads around the community. I realise in life, what is important to you, is sometimes not important to others, but having these indifference is what makes us all interesting, unique and evidently makes the world go round and complete. I am practical and transparent. if I don't know something or I don't understand, I m not afraid to ask. I strongly believe facts need to be sought for everybody to have correct information so that we can all make any relative and important decisions.

As a Gawler resident I am involved with the RSL, Director Womens Football at South Gawler and facilitator at Men Building Connections. I enjoy the opportunity to volunteer and participate in my community wherever I can at any level. As a prospective Councillor I will bring a wealth of planning and operations experience from 40 years working in the public sector both Federal and State. I see the future dynamic growth of Gawler and its environs requires councillors who have a vision for the now and the future growth of town which is growing exponentially towards being a regional hub for families, business and education.

I present myself as a candidate for Town of Gawler Council as a long term resident of Hillier. Professionally, I am an accountant, with several years experience as a company director for our family business. My family and I moved to Gawler 30 years ago to pursue an interest in breeding show horses, and I still live on the same property. I believe I have a clear understanding of the issues concerning Gawler's rural zones, and will advocate for the interests of local residents to be heard. I am currently Chairperson of SA Arabian Riders & Breeders Soc. Work and career experiences have led to an interest in environmental issues, including the admirable goals established through Gawler's Climate Change Emergency Action Plan. I make a commitment to be approachable by all residents, and respect the desire for ratepayers to be assured of receiving value for money.

My wife and I have lived in Gawler since 1979, we have raised our family here, made many good friends and will always call Gawler home. In 2018 it was a privilege to be elected to council and during the last four busy and challenging years I have been involved in a number of council committees in addition to being councils’ representative on the Council (Development) Assessment Panel. My local government employment background (forty years in the building, planning and public health fields) contributes to a sound knowledge of how councils work and the important issues affecting growing communities such as Gawler. I have no political affiliations, no vested commercial interests and by bringing maturity, experience and common sense to council I would like to think I can help ensure Gawler remains a great place to live. I look forward to representing all residents for a further four years and would appreciate your support.

In consultation with ratepayers, I will listen and deliver upon the needs of our community, to improve services and facilities. My television experience through the production of Off the Couch with Ethan has provided me the opportunity to explore many regions of South Australia and I believe there is more the Town of Gawler can do to improve our community for residents and visitors. My ongoing community involvement has been acknowledged by being named the Town of Gawler Young Citizen of the Year in 2019 & 2022. I am a Xavier College Old Scholar, where I now work part time, along with studying a Bachelor of Film and Television at the University of South Australia. I see great potential for Gawler through further development of youth facilities and activities, increase in tourism opportunities and the expansion of support to community organisations.

I have lived in the Gawler area nearly 40 years. Educated here, worked my first jobs here, married here, raised our family here, and have run our business on Murray St for more than 20 years. Being in the main street 6 days a week for more than two decades has taught me a lot about what the people of Gawler want and need, and what they are and aren t getting from their Council. I am passionate about many things including arts and culture, youth, community clubs and groups and creating a town that people are proud to call home. A town our next generation can also call home if they so choose. Ensuring ratepayers get value for money from their rates and grants Town of Gawler receives is of critical importance to me. Covid has been really tough for many of us, and the effects are still being felt. If elected you can rest assured I will call out waste and bring a perspective to Council that knows all too well the value of a dollar. Learn more about me or get in touch at shanebailey.com.au

I have chosen to run for council as I believe I shall bring a lot of enthusiasm, dedication and expertise to the position. I have lived in Gawler for near on 40 years and have witnessed the growth of our community and enjoy how the town has developed throughout that time. I'm married with two grown children whom have been educated in Gawler and both are growing to be fine adults and still residing in Gawler. I have worked professionally in the local community for the past 6 years and look forward to many more years. My choice to join the Council is not born out of any hidden or personal agenda but to be a voice for the like minded people and to help support the vision of the community as a whole. I will stand up for what I believe and not be a yes man. There is a lot of community developments that the council has the power to support - local industries / businesses and I will be on the front foot to assist in this development.

As the longest serving chair of the Gawler Business Development Group I have been closer than most to the inner workings of council. I seek to represent the interests of ratepayers, residential, commercial and home based business. I bring a background in a number of areas including having built a successful cleaning business from the ground up, providing work for up to 11 people. In Gawler my experience includes Job Network, working in business development, training and counselling which gave me a deep understanding of the needs of business and employees. I have been involved in a number of community organisations, serving on management committees in each case. I bring a resolve to ensure the resources of council are managed in the best interests of the future of the rapidly developing area of Gawler and all the rate payers of the town.

My connection to Gawler goes back nearly 40 years to when we bought our first home in Willaston. Soon afterwards I was employed by Council to establish the very popular Gawler Public Library. Since then, I have raised two children, cared for my aged parents and been an active member of this strong, cohesive community. I still get a buzz from the amazing things that can be achieved by those who contribute their time and energy to Gawler. I am committed to supporting their efforts, especially during this period of unprecedented growth. Gawler must thrive not simply survive. I have also worked in the academic sector, the private sector, and for the CFS as a community engagement officer using qualifications in management, education, communication and history. I am a member of the GP Inc Board, Councils Gawler Heritage Committee, Gawler History Team, Friends of Willaston Cemetery and Gawler Repair Café. I seek your support so I may represent you as an elected member for the next four years.

As a 32-year-old who has just completed my first term on the Gawler Council, I can bring a fresh perspective on what Gawler needs, while also using my local government experience to ensure that the community's concerns are not buried by bureaucracy. I have a proven track record of turning ideas into action; this past year, one of my motions allowed residents to directly vote on $40,000 of the Council budget, which got three hundred residents democratically involved in our budget process. My main concern for Gawler is that if we fail to adapt to the rapid development growth in this area, we could gradually lose our unique identity as a town. To ensure that we do not simply become another 'commuter town', we need to be on the front foot in making our new and younger residents feel like their residence in Gawler is not just a house, but a home.

Having grown up in Gawler I have important insights into many of the challenges that local people face. After attending Trinity College I took up traineeship in Government later commencing employment as a Court Officer in the Magistrates Court. After my traineeship I commenced a double degree in Law and History at the University of South Australia. While studying I have served as UniSA Student President and elected representative on the UniSA Council. In recent years I have served on the Gawler Youth Advisory Committee, and campaigned for better transport believing that public transport isn’t just about getting from a to b, it’s about getting to work, getting an education and giving freedom to all, no matter ability or age. I believe Council should be about empowering community, whether it’s supporting local sporting clubs and community groups, smart planning and development or providing people with the means to live sustainably. It’s the small things done right that make a difference.

👤Sam Shetler
Evanston South's Sam Shetler said council can be a vehicle for change. The society and environment teacher is no stranger to local government, having taken an interest in the sector through his role in grassroots advocacy. Growing up in poverty in the US before shifting to Gawler, Mr Shetler was a founding member of Anti-Poverty Network SA. In 2019 he addressed council for its support in backing a raise to the Newstart allowance. His advocacy has continued, most recently speaking to council on a petition he created for improvements to the Gawler Skatepark. Mr Shetler said two of his key focus areas, if elected, would be increasing community participation in council matters and addressing the cost of living through council-led initiatives. This is a paraphrase of the news article 'Shetler to Stand for Council' published in The Bunyip on the 8th of June 2022. If you'd like to know more about me, you can ring me on 0421 944 452.

I'm proud to call Gawler home. I'm equally proud to have been chosen to be your elected member in the 2018 elections. I define an elected member as one that is contactable, that listens, and moves to get the best outcomes for our town. I have always voiced the logic that I believe is expected on the items the chamber addresses. I admit, I haven't always been successful at getting that logic agreed to, but I have been consistent whilst learning a lot. I am proud of my achievements to date; however, there is still work to do. I believe our council needs to ensure the fundamental service levels align with ratepayer expectations whilst also improving on community engagement. I'm a 33-year-old husband, father, building project manager and 2018 -2022 councillor. I'm hoping to get my community's support once again to be their voice. For those who follow council business you know my loyalties have always been with our community. Go to nathanshanks.com.au to find out more. Our vote! Our town!

Having owned and operated the Table Top Warfare business in Gawler for the last 6 years has made myself, my partner Alicia and our 3 young boys fall in love with all that Gawler has to offer. I am keen to help drive the success of all businesses within Gawler and feel I could be a positive voice to help local business owners achieve their goals and assist to resolve any issues preventing success. Contribution and active participation in the community has always been an integral part of my time in the Gawler area. I feel I would be well positioned to continue that contribution further if elected to Council. Social inclusion is also something I am really passionate about. I feel there should be more funding and better opportunities for people with special needs, social minority groups, social clubs and youth in the area. Being my first time running for council, I would love the opportunity to make a difference and have a positive impact on the wider Gawler community. www.waynefischer.com

I have been raised in Gawler since 1987 and 20yrs of those have been as a rate payer. I would by now like to consider myself and family locals, although this has seen me at times come in and out of the area, Gawler has always been the place I refer to as home. I strive to be open and honest with the community to assist the council in important decisions that will see happier future generations thrive in this community. What Im passionate about is youth and general employment, traffic congestion and safer roads around the community. I realise in life, what is important to you, is sometimes not important to others, but having these indifference is what makes us all interesting, unique and evidently makes the world go round and complete. I am practical and transparent. if I don't know something or I don't understand, I m not afraid to ask. I strongly believe facts need to be sought for everybody to have correct information so that we can all make any relative and important decisions.

My wife and I have lived in Gawler since 1979, we have raised our family here, made many good friends and will always call Gawler home. In 2018 it was a privilege to be elected to council and during the last four busy and challenging years I have been involved in a number of council committees in addition to being councils’ representative on the Council (Development) Assessment Panel. My local government employment background (forty years in the building, planning and public health fields) contributes to a sound knowledge of how councils work and the important issues affecting growing communities such as Gawler. I have no political affiliations, no vested commercial interests and by bringing maturity, experience and common sense to council I would like to think I can help ensure Gawler remains a great place to live. I look forward to representing all residents for a further four years and would appreciate your support.

I have chosen to run for council as I believe I shall bring a lot of enthusiasm, dedication and expertise to the position. I have lived in Gawler for near on 40 years and have witnessed the growth of our community and enjoy how the town has developed throughout that time. I'm married with two grown children whom have been educated in Gawler and both are growing to be fine adults and still residing in Gawler. I have worked professionally in the local community for the past 6 years and look forward to many more years. My choice to join the Council is not born out of any hidden or personal agenda but to be a voice for the like minded people and to help support the vision of the community as a whole. I will stand up for what I believe and not be a yes man. There is a lot of community developments that the council has the power to support - local industries / businesses and I will be on the front foot to assist in this development.

As the longest serving chair of the Gawler Business Development Group I have been closer than most to the inner workings of council. I seek to represent the interests of ratepayers, residential, commercial and home based business. I bring a background in a number of areas including having built a successful cleaning business from the ground up, providing work for up to 11 people. In Gawler my experience includes Job Network, working in business development, training and counselling which gave me a deep understanding of the needs of business and employees. I have been involved in a number of community organisations, serving on management committees in each case. I bring a resolve to ensure the resources of council are managed in the best interests of the future of the rapidly developing area of Gawler and all the rate payers of the town.

My connection to Gawler goes back nearly 40 years to when we bought our first home in Willaston. Soon afterwards I was employed by Council to establish the very popular Gawler Public Library. Since then, I have raised two children, cared for my aged parents and been an active member of this strong, cohesive community. I still get a buzz from the amazing things that can be achieved by those who contribute their time and energy to Gawler. I am committed to supporting their efforts, especially during this period of unprecedented growth. Gawler must thrive not simply survive. I have also worked in the academic sector, the private sector, and for the CFS as a community engagement officer using qualifications in management, education, communication and history. I am a member of the GP Inc Board, Councils Gawler Heritage Committee, Gawler History Team, Friends of Willaston Cemetery and Gawler Repair Café. I seek your support so I may represent you as an elected member for the next four years.

As a 32-year-old who has just completed my first term on the Gawler Council, I can bring a fresh perspective on what Gawler needs, while also using my local government experience to ensure that the community's concerns are not buried by bureaucracy. I have a proven track record of turning ideas into action; this past year, one of my motions allowed residents to directly vote on $40,000 of the Council budget, which got three hundred residents democratically involved in our budget process. My main concern for Gawler is that if we fail to adapt to the rapid development growth in this area, we could gradually lose our unique identity as a town. To ensure that we do not simply become another 'commuter town', we need to be on the front foot in making our new and younger residents feel like their residence in Gawler is not just a house, but a home.

Having grown up in Gawler I have important insights into many of the challenges that local people face. After attending Trinity College I took up traineeship in Government later commencing employment as a Court Officer in the Magistrates Court. After my traineeship I commenced a double degree in Law and History at the University of South Australia. While studying I have served as UniSA Student President and elected representative on the UniSA Council. In recent years I have served on the Gawler Youth Advisory Committee, and campaigned for better transport believing that public transport isn’t just about getting from a to b, it’s about getting to work, getting an education and giving freedom to all, no matter ability or age. I believe Council should be about empowering community, whether it’s supporting local sporting clubs and community groups, smart planning and development or providing people with the means to live sustainably. It’s the small things done right that make a difference.

👤Sam Shetler
Evanston South's Sam Shetler said council can be a vehicle for change. The society and environment teacher is no stranger to local government, having taken an interest in the sector through his role in grassroots advocacy. Growing up in poverty in the US before shifting to Gawler, Mr Shetler was a founding member of Anti-Poverty Network SA. In 2019 he addressed council for its support in backing a raise to the Newstart allowance. His advocacy has continued, most recently speaking to council on a petition he created for improvements to the Gawler Skatepark. Mr Shetler said two of his key focus areas, if elected, would be increasing community participation in council matters and addressing the cost of living through council-led initiatives. This is a paraphrase of the news article 'Shetler to Stand for Council' published in The Bunyip on the 8th of June 2022. If you'd like to know more about me, you can ring me on 0421 944 452.

I'm proud to call Gawler home. I'm equally proud to have been chosen to be your elected member in the 2018 elections. I define an elected member as one that is contactable, that listens, and moves to get the best outcomes for our town. I have always voiced the logic that I believe is expected on the items the chamber addresses. I admit, I haven't always been successful at getting that logic agreed to, but I have been consistent whilst learning a lot. I am proud of my achievements to date; however, there is still work to do. I believe our council needs to ensure the fundamental service levels align with ratepayer expectations whilst also improving on community engagement. I'm a 33-year-old husband, father, building project manager and 2018 -2022 councillor. I'm hoping to get my community's support once again to be their voice.

Having owned and operated the Table Top Warfare business in Gawler for the last 6 years has made myself, my partner Alicia and our 3 young boys fall in love with all that Gawler has to offer. I am keen to help drive the success of all businesses within Gawler and feel I could be a positive voice to help local business owners achieve their goals and assist to resolve any issues preventing success. Contribution and active participation in the community has always been an integral part of my time in the Gawler area. I feel I would be well positioned to continue that contribution further if elected to Council. Social inclusion is also something I am really passionate about. I feel there should be more funding and better opportunities for people with special needs, social minority groups, social clubs and youth in the area. Being my first time running for council, I would love the opportunity to make a difference and have a positive impact on the wider Gawler community. www.waynefischer.com

I have been raised in Gawler since 1987 and 20yrs of those have been as a rate payer. I would by now like to consider myself and family locals, although this has seen me at times come in and out of the area, Gawler has always been the place I refer to as home. I strive to be open and honest with the community to assist the council in important decisions that will see happier future generations thrive in this community. What Im passionate about is youth and general employment, traffic congestion and safer roads around the community. I realise in life, what is important to you, is sometimes not important to others, but having these indifference is what makes us all interesting, unique and evidently makes the world go round and complete. I am practical and transparent. if I don't know something or I don't understand, I m not afraid to ask. I strongly believe facts need to be sought for everybody to have correct information so that we can all make any relative and important decisions.

As a Gawler resident I am involved with the RSL, Director Womens Football at South Gawler and facilitator at Men Building Connections. I enjoy the opportunity to volunteer and participate in my community wherever I can at any level. As a prospective Councillor I will bring a wealth of planning and operations experience from 40 years working in the public sector both Federal and State. I see the future dynamic growth of Gawler and its environs requires councillors who have a vision for the now and the future growth of town which is growing exponentially towards being a regional hub for families, business and education.

I present myself as a candidate for Town of Gawler Council as a long term resident of Hillier. Professionally, I am an accountant, with several years experience as a company director for our family business. My family and I moved to Gawler 30 years ago to pursue an interest in breeding show horses, and I still live on the same property. I believe I have a clear understanding of the issues concerning Gawler's rural zones, and will advocate for the interests of local residents to be heard. I am currently Chairperson of SA Arabian Riders & Breeders Soc. Work and career experiences have led to an interest in environmental issues, including the admirable goals established through Gawler's Climate Change Emergency Action Plan. I make a commitment to be approachable by all residents, and respect the desire for ratepayers to be assured of receiving value for money.

My wife and I have lived in Gawler since 1979, we have raised our family here, made many good friends and will always call Gawler home. In 2018 it was a privilege to be elected to council and during the last four busy and challenging years I have been involved in a number of council committees in addition to being councils’ representative on the Council (Development) Assessment Panel. My local government employment background (forty years in the building, planning and public health fields) contributes to a sound knowledge of how councils work and the important issues affecting growing communities such as Gawler. I have no political affiliations, no vested commercial interests and by bringing maturity, experience and common sense to council I would like to think I can help ensure Gawler remains a great place to live. I look forward to representing all residents for a further four years and would appreciate your support.

Nominating for Council will allow me to serve a community which has played a significant part in my personal and professional development. In consultation with ratepayers, I will listen and deliver upon the needs of our community, to improve services and facilities. My television experience through the production of Off the Couch with Ethan has provided me the opportunity to explore many regions of South Australia and I believe there is more the Town of Gawler can do to improve our community for residents and visitors. My ongoing community involvement has been acknowledged by being named the Town of Gawler Young Citizen of the Year in 2019 & 2022. I am a Xavier College Old Scholar, where I now work part time, along with studying a Bachelor of Film and Television at the University of South Australia. I see great potential for Gawler through further development of youth facilities and activities, increase in tourism opportunities and the expansion of support to community organisations.

Brian Sambells service to Gawler is well documented, having completed his education here, he entered into a business environment, operated an outback safari tour, was Manager of the Gawler Visitor and Information Centre before first being elected as Mayor of Gawler in 2010. The role of an elected member is three fold, firstly it is to make decisions that are in the communities best interest by balancing the priorities of competing areas and interest groups and trying to act for the betterment of the community as a whole. Secondly, it is to advocate for people who may not feel confident in representing themselves against the Council. We are the communities voice. Thirdly, it is to be good leaders and role models by always choosing to unite the community and not to divide it. Brian Sambell has a strong history of representing the community in Gawler. It is important to vote in local government elections to ensure your representatives represent you diligently and respectfully.

I have lived in the Gawler area nearly 40 years. Educated here, worked my first jobs here, married here, raised our family here, and have run our business on Murray St for more than 20 years. Being in the main street 6 days a week for more than two decades has taught me a lot about what the people of Gawler want and need, and what they are and aren t getting from their Council. I am passionate about many things including arts and culture, youth, community clubs and groups and creating a town that people are proud to call home. A town our next generation can also call home if they so choose. Ensuring ratepayers get value for money from their rates and grants Town of Gawler receives is of critical importance to me. Covid has been really tough for many of us, and the effects are still being felt. If elected you can rest assured I will call out waste and bring a perspective to Council that knows all too well the value of a dollar. Learn more about me or get in touch at shanebailey.com.au

I may be new to the opportunity to become a councillor, but I am definitely not new when it comes to having the passion to want our town to continue taking steps to be and do better. Originally born and raised in Gawler and continuing to live here, I have seen first hand this town transform and grow in many positive ways. I have heard of the struggles that some may have and believe I can make a difference in relation to showing genuine empathy to individual needs and community ventures. If elected I believe I will be a valuable member and a voice for the many as I have the vital skills to listen to and do what is important. I am a quiet achiever who loves to get the job done. Previously I worked in the Education sector as an assistant director for many years, and now work independently for myself to support the older generation in their own homes. Working with a broad spectrum of people has assisted me to have a far better understanding of our cultures and how to grow.

Having owned and operated the Table Top Warfare business in Gawler for the last 6 years has made myself, my partner Alicia and our 3 young boys fall in love with all that Gawler has to offer. I am keen to help drive the success of all businesses within Gawler and feel I could be a positive voice to help local business owners achieve their goals and assist to resolve any issues preventing success. Contribution and active participation in the community has always been an integral part of my time in the Gawler area. I feel I would be well positioned to continue that contribution further if elected to Council. Social inclusion is also something I am really passionate about. I feel there should be more funding and better opportunities for people with special needs, social minority groups, social clubs and youth in the area. Being my first time running for council, I would love the opportunity to make a difference and have a positive impact on the wider Gawler community. www.waynefischer.com

I have been raised in Gawler since 1987 and 20yrs of those have been as a rate payer. I would by now like to consider myself and family locals, although this has seen me at times come in and out of the area, Gawler has always been the place I refer to as home. I strive to be open and honest with the community to assist the council in important decisions that will see happier future generations thrive in this community. What Im passionate about is youth and general employment, traffic congestion and safer roads around the community. I realise in life, what is important to you, is sometimes not important to others, but having these indifference is what makes us all interesting, unique and evidently makes the world go round and complete. I am practical and transparent. if I don't know something or I don't understand, I m not afraid to ask. I strongly believe facts need to be sought for everybody to have correct information so that we can all make any relative and important decisions.

As a Gawler resident I am involved with the RSL, Director Womens Football at South Gawler and facilitator at Men Building Connections. I enjoy the opportunity to volunteer and participate in my community wherever I can at any level. As a prospective Councillor I will bring a wealth of planning and operations experience from 40 years working in the public sector both Federal and State. I see the future dynamic growth of Gawler and its environs requires councillors who have a vision for the now and the future growth of town which is growing exponentially towards being a regional hub for families, business and education.

I present myself as a candidate for Town of Gawler Council as a long term resident of Hillier. Professionally, I am an accountant, with several years experience as a company director for our family business. My family and I moved to Gawler 30 years ago to pursue an interest in breeding show horses, and I still live on the same property. I believe I have a clear understanding of the issues concerning Gawler's rural zones, and will advocate for the interests of local residents to be heard. I am currently Chairperson of SA Arabian Riders & Breeders Soc. Work and career experiences have led to an interest in environmental issues, including the admirable goals established through Gawler's Climate Change Emergency Action Plan. I make a commitment to be approachable by all residents, and respect the desire for ratepayers to be assured of receiving value for money. I can be contacted at karenbrunt9@gmail.com, or via my Facebook page Karen Brunt

My wife and I have lived in Gawler since 1979, we have raised our family here, made many good friends and will always call Gawler home. In 2018 it was a privilege to be elected to council and during the last four busy and challenging years I have been involved in a number of council committees in addition to being councils’ representative on the Council (Development) Assessment Panel. My local government employment background (forty years in the building, planning and public health fields) contributes to a sound knowledge of how councils work and the important issues affecting growing communities such as Gawler. I have no political affiliations, no vested commercial interests and by bringing maturity, experience and common sense to council I would like to think I can help ensure Gawler remains a great place to live. I look forward to representing all residents for a further four years and would appreciate your support.

Nominating for Council will allow me to serve a community which has played a significant part in my personal and professional development. In consultation with ratepayers, I will listen and deliver upon the needs of our community, to improve services and facilities. My television experience through the production of Off the Couch with Ethan has provided me the opportunity to explore many regions of South Australia and I believe there is more the Town of Gawler can do to improve our community for residents and visitors. My ongoing community involvement has been acknowledged by being named the Town of Gawler Young Citizen of the Year in 2019 & 2022. I am a Xavier College Old Scholar, where I now work part time, along with studying a Bachelor of Film and Television at the University of South Australia. I see great potential for Gawler through further development of youth facilities and activities, increase in tourism opportunities and the expansion of support to community organisations.

Brian Sambells service to Gawler is well documented, having completed his education here, he entered into a business environment, operated an outback safari tour, was Manager of the Gawler Visitor and Information Centre before first being elected as Mayor of Gawler in 2010. The role of an elected member is three fold, firstly it is to make decisions that are in the communities best interest by balancing the priorities of competing areas and interest groups and trying to act for the betterment of the community as a whole. Secondly, it is to advocate for people who may not feel confident in representing themselves against the Council. We are the communities voice. Thirdly, it is to be good leaders and role models by always choosing to unite the community and not to divide it. Brian Sambell has a strong history of representing the community in Gawler. It is important to vote in local government elections to ensure your representatives represent you diligently and respectfully.

I have lived in the Gawler area nearly 40 years. Educated here, worked my first jobs here, married here, raised our family here, and have run our business on Murray St for more than 20 years. Being in the main street 6 days a week for more than two decades has taught me a lot about what the people of Gawler want and need, and what they are and aren t getting from their Council. I am passionate about many things including arts and culture, youth, community clubs and groups and creating a town that people are proud to call home. A town our next generation can also call home if they so choose. Ensuring ratepayers get value for money from their rates and grants Town of Gawler receives is of critical importance to me. Covid has been really tough for many of us, and the effects are still being felt. If elected you can rest assured I will call out waste and bring a perspective to Council that knows all too well the value of a dollar. Learn more about me or get in touch at shanebailey.com.au

I may be new to the opportunity to become a councillor, but I am definitely not new when it comes to having the passion to want our town to continue taking steps to be and do better. Originally born and raised in Gawler and continuing to live here, I have seen first hand this town transform and grow in many positive ways. I have heard of the struggles that some may have and believe I can make a difference in relation to showing genuine empathy to individual needs and community ventures. If elected I believe I will be a valuable member and a voice for the many as I have the vital skills to listen to and do what is important. I am a quiet achiever who loves to get the job done. Previously I worked in the Education sector as an assistant director for many years, and now work independently for myself to support the older generation in their own homes. Working with a broad spectrum of people has assisted me to have a far better understanding of our cultures and how to grow.

The homeless is a great concern to me and we as a council need to apply some assistance to these people. I am interested in the growth of all sporting clubs and all community groups.

Gawler has been lucky to have a variety of people of different backgrounds working together to keep our town a Vibrant and Caring Community.

I have chosen to run for council as I believe I shall bring a lot of enthusiasm, dedication and expertise to the position. I have lived in Gawler for near on 40 years and have witnessed the growth of our community and enjoy how the town has developed throughout that time. I'm married with two grown children whom have been educated in Gawler and both are growing to be fine adults and still residing in Gawler. I have worked professionally in the local community for the past 6 years and look forward to many more years. My choice to join the Council is not born out of any hidden or personal agenda but to be a voice for the like minded people and to help support the vision of the community as a whole. I will stand up for what I believe and not be a yes man. There is a lot of community developments that the council has the power to support - local industries / businesses and I will be on the front foot to assist in this development.

My connection to Gawler goes back nearly 40 years to when we bought our first home in Willaston. Soon afterwards I was employed by Council to establish the very popular Gawler Public Library. Since then, I have raised two children, cared for my aged parents and been an active member of this strong, cohesive community. I still get a buzz from the amazing things that can be achieved by those who contribute their time and energy to Gawler. I am committed to supporting their efforts, especially during this period of unprecedented growth. Gawler must thrive not simply survive. I have also worked in the academic sector, the private sector, and for the CFS as a community engagement officer using qualifications in management, education, communication and history. I am a member of the GP Inc Board, Councils Gawler Heritage Committee, Gawler History Team, Friends of Willaston Cemetery and Gawler Repair Café. I seek your support so I may represent you as an elected member for the next four years.

As a 32-year-old who has just completed my first term on the Gawler Council, I can bring a fresh perspective on what Gawler needs, while also using my local government experience to ensure that the community's concerns are not buried by bureaucracy. I have a proven track record of turning ideas into action; this past year, one of my motions allowed residents to directly vote on $40,000 of the Council budget, which got three hundred residents democratically involved in our budget process. My main concern for Gawler is that if we fail to adapt to the rapid development growth in this area, we could gradually lose our unique identity as a town. To ensure that we do not simply become another 'commuter town', we need to be on the front foot in making our new and younger residents feel like their residence in Gawler is not just a house, but a home.

Having grown up in Gawler I have important insights into many of the challenges that local people face. After attending Trinity College I took up traineeship in Government later commencing employment as a Court Officer in the Magistrates Court. After my traineeship I commenced a double degree in Law and History at the University of South Australia. While studying I have served as UniSA Student President and elected representative on the UniSA Council. In recent years I have served on the Gawler Youth Advisory Committee, and campaigned for better transport believing that public transport isn’t just about getting from a to b, it’s about getting to work, getting an education and giving freedom to all, no matter ability or age. I believe Council should be about empowering community, whether it’s supporting local sporting clubs and community groups, smart planning and development or providing people with the means to live sustainably. It’s the small things done right that make a difference.

Ben Davison is BACK after a two week break with a deep dive on the FIVE big issues that should be dominating the national debate.

1. 98% of our public schools don't have the resources they need.  Ben reads out a message from a listener about how the failure to support every child has left class sizes too big, teachers overworked and kids missing out on the support they need.

2. #Inflation is coming down.  The spokesperson from the bosses pamphlet on Insiders continued to recite the neo-liberal mantras of higher rates, more unemployment and lower wages but Ben outlines how Jim Chalmers and Labor are implementing a neo-Keynesian approach that is bringing down prices, keeping people in work and supporting those most in need.

3.  Workplace reforms are coming to parliament to stop the multi-billion dollar loopholes that see labour hire workers paid less, forced casualisation of millions of people and profiteering at working people's expense.  There's a union for every worker, casual, labour hire, teacher, miner, nurse, graphic designer and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow

4. The Housing Affordability Future Fund is coming back.  With $1,300,000 a day NOT going into housing because of the Greens back Dutton's Noalition Labor is ready to set up a double dissolution trigger.

5. The Voice.  Greg Sheridan can go on #Insiders to say that Dutton isn't racists if the referendum fails but if all the racists are voting NO does it matter if he considers himself to be racist?  Ben argues you pick a side.  No has Pauline Hanson and Andrew Bolt.  Yes has Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson.

Which side are you on?

Plus Ben touches on why the noise around the Rockingham by-election is meaningless Liberal narrative and why Dutton's abysmal record on government contracts is best left to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to determine.

Van Badham and Ben Davison look at how actors, screen writers and even NRL players are getting organised because they need the power of standing together to get a fair deal.  Remember to join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

With the NO campaign in full swing the Murdoch Empire has clearly identified its target market.  Van and Ben discuss why a Royal Commission into the influence of the Murdoch Empire is a good idea, why it is NOT a ""news"" source and present examples of it pushing a narrative that undermines truth while backing in racists.

Inflation continues to fall despite the neo-liberals saying we would need to see hundreds of thousands of people made unemployed for it to happen.  Ben and Van discuss how the high priests of monetary policy twist every outcome to support their ideology and why it is Labor's macro-economic management and the community demanding an end to profiteering that is bringing inflation down WITHOUT scrapping thousands of jobs.

With unemployment at 3.5% and millions of people trapped in casual employment but working the same hours every week for less money, the union movement has thrown its support behind the Labor Government's plan to end forced casualisation.  Ben and Van discuss what this means, how it will empower workers and dispel the doomsayers from the Noalition.

The good news is about trees being planted!

We have even more supporters and Van reads out the names of all our Cadre and Extend the Reach supporters.  If you want episodes emailed to you, along with links and more information, go to www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday

Van Badham and Ben Davison start this special Thursday edition by tearing apart the ridiculous wage cutting ideologies of Jeff Kennet and exploring why a man who's devoted his life to cutting wages wanting to cut wages isn't news but it is bad for productivity, women and workers in general. 

Which is why unions are campaigning for more flexibility to work from home and you can join them at australianunions.org.au/wow

The Guardian has exposed that the NO campaign has been importing American MAGA campaign tactics for the referendum with evidence that two companies in particular are making more than a dollar from dividing Australia with racist, sexist and classist hatred.

The Robodebt Royal Commission handed down its report six days ago so Van and Ben explore how the Liberals have responded by denying any wrong doing, making accusations against Labor and doing everything they can to undermine their own chances in the Fadden by-election this Saturday.

Ben and Van also contrast the failures of Dutton as defence and home affairs minister against the work Albo is doing to defend democracy at the NATO summit while also improving our trade relations.  Van and Ben make clear that there is no ""left wing"" way to support Putin's gangster state and recall some of their own experiences in the nuclear armed kleptocracy. 

The good news is that solar glass is a thing and windows that make electricity are on their way!

Ben Davison returns with the Weekend Wrap to breakdown the landslide Labor victory in NSW.  With Labor set to win its biggest ever majority when coming into government from opposition.  

Labor's lower house performance was only bettered by its performance in the upper house where it has achieved a 9% swing and battered the Liberal/National coalition. 

Ben breaks down some of the seats that Labor won, some of the seats where there is a genuine close contest and just why the media continues to be so out of touch.

Chris Minns will become the 47th Premier of NSW with a mandate for change while Dom Perrottet and his supporters in the media are left to shake their heads and claim that it wasn't Labor's focus on wages, more teachers, minimum health service staffing levels, banning privatisation, investing in more local jobs and refusal to get sucked into fringe issues pushed by the media but just that it people thought it was time to mix things up a bit.

Australian Unions President Michele O'Neil will be giving a National Press Club address on Tuesday focussing on how we move to net zero with workers winning rather than paying the bill for billionaires and Ben links this approach to how Labor in NSW campaigned.  Putting people first. 

Unions always put people, particularly their members, first and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow Just look at how teachers, nurses, train drivers, child care workers, cleaners and more have been coming together in union and winning change across Australia.

Ben looks at Insiders treatment of the Voice question announcement and their interview with Attorney General Mark Dreyfus.  Ben does not believe Peter Dutton's support is needed for the referendum to be a success and raises his concern that if the billionaire owned media performs as badly during the referendum as they have during the last few state and federal elections by amplifying loud minority positions it could be a problem, for the media.  

The referendum, like the elections and the marriage equality plebiscite, will be won by people getting involved so check out Yes23 or Unions for YES to see how you can be part of a better future.

And don't forget you can catch up on Ben and Van's interview with Chris Minns in Episode 104 from December 7th 2022 to get some more insight into what Labor will be doing to deliver a fresh start for NSW.

The Murdoch organisation has boycotted the Adelaide Fringe, Australia's largest arts festival, after a dispute about advertising.  Van and Ben look at what Australia's NINTH largest newspaper boycotting Australia's largest arts event has to do with Trump, Fox News, Sky News and the cultural war that has turned news audiences into market segments.

In the Yurt Van and Ben expose that ""broccolini"" is a trademarked term and that some of the agri-corp businesses, many around Adelaide, may not be all they seem.  The United Workers Union are encouraging people to contact Coles and Woolworths to demand that exploitation doesn't make it on Australian tables.  Don't forget you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

With The Statement from the Heart YES campaign launching and the Unions for YES campaign underway Van and Ben open the show with a traditional acknowledgement of country and discuss how Murdoch's NO campaign is as much about about subscription and advertising sales as it is trying to stop the referendum.

Albo spoke at the National Press Club about the concepts that underpin national security and Ben and Van explore how a broader understanding of security, security of employment, of pay, of opportunity and community participation comes together as the counter to the Murdoch organisation's project and Dutton's ""Noalition"".

Plus there is good news about renewable energy batteries.

Ben Davison looks at the recent polling showing a surge in support for Chris Minns and the NSW Labor party at the expense of Dom Perrottet's Liberal/National coalition government.  Ben goes through why working people have had enough of the cuts, the costs and the waste during  a decade of mismanagement by the Liberals.  Also how unions are getting organised to win better pay, services and more secure jobs, join them at australianunions.org.au/wow 

You can check out Van and Ben's interview with Labor leader Chris Minns from December 7th on Episode 114 of The Week on Wednesday.

The Voice enjoys support from a majority of Australian's in a majority of states.  While Dutton ""reaches for the Abbott playbook"" and the conservative media try to pretend otherwise every state, except Queensland, would deliver a comfortable majority YES to for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice referendum.  Ben breaks it down state by state.

Ben touches on the retirement of Jacinda Ardern. Van's Guardian article articulates why she was important, not just to New Zealand but to many people around the world.

Ben closes off with an examination of the escalating problems at Qantas.  Remember you can hear what the maintenance workers were telling Ben and Van back in September in Episode 104 about Joyce's cuts.  SIX MONTHS BEFORE the four ""mechanical issues"" in three days that the airline has suffered this week.
