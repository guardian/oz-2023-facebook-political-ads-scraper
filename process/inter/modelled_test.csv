üåü I‚Äôm here to help women and non-binary folks learn to play and sing the guitar! üåü

üéµ My mission is to create a supportive and inclusive community where everyone can discover the joy of music. Led by me, @phillipacookman, I‚Äôm dedicated to empowering individuals traditionally underrepresented in the guitar-playing world.

üé∂ I‚Äôm a passionate (and professional) vocalist and guitarist and I want this platform to bridge the gender gap and provide a safe space for all singers and guitarists. Whether you're a beginner or have been making music for years, we've got you covered!

üåà I offer bespoke coaching programmes that are tailored to your needs and aspirations. From belting out your favourite Celine numbers to advanced strumming patterns and chord progressions, we cover a wide range of musical styles and genres, ensuring a well-rounded learning experience.

üé§ I believe singing and playing the guitar go hand in hand! Develop your vocal abilities alongside your instrumental skills, with guidance on breath control, pitch accuracy, and performance techniques. Let's find your authentic voice as a musician!

üí´ But it doesn't stop there! I host group workshops, practice sessions and live lessons to foster a strong sense of community. Connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate, and grow together!

üåü With The Singing Guitarists, I‚Äôm committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity within the music industry. Together, let's challenge stereotypes and break down barriers, empowering women and non-binary individuals to shine in their musical journeys.

üéâ Join us at The Singing Guitarists, and embark on a transformative musical adventure filled with creativity, empowerment, and the pure joy of making music! üéâ

üëâ Tag your friends who've been dreaming of playing the guitar and singing in the comments! Let's spread the word and inspire others to embrace their musical talents. üåü

In the coming months we will have the opportunity to go to a referendum to enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the Constitution.

There is still entrenched disadvantage in Indigenous communities resulting in poorer health outcomes, shorter life expectancy and higher incarceration rates.  

We know that when we listen to people on the ground, we get better outcomes. It‚Äôs important you know the difference between voting yes and voting no. 

If you would like to learn more about the referendum and how it will benefit all Australians please consider attending this event to hear from:

Ben Davison is BACK after a two week break with a deep dive on the FIVE big issues that should be dominating the national debate.

1. 98% of our public schools don't have the resources they need.  Ben reads out a message from a listener about how the failure to support every child has left class sizes too big, teachers overworked and kids missing out on the support they need.

2. #Inflation is coming down.  The spokesperson from the bosses pamphlet on Insiders continued to recite the neo-liberal mantras of higher rates, more unemployment and lower wages but Ben outlines how Jim Chalmers and Labor are implementing a neo-Keynesian approach that is bringing down prices, keeping people in work and supporting those most in need.

3.  Workplace reforms are coming to parliament to stop the multi-billion dollar loopholes that see labour hire workers paid less, forced casualisation of millions of people and profiteering at working people's expense.  There's a union for every worker, casual, labour hire, teacher, miner, nurse, graphic designer and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow

4. The Housing Affordability Future Fund is coming back.  With $1,300,000 a day NOT going into housing because of the Greens back Dutton's Noalition Labor is ready to set up a double dissolution trigger.

5. The Voice.  Greg Sheridan can go on #Insiders to say that Dutton isn't racists if the referendum fails but if all the racists are voting NO does it matter if he considers himself to be racist?  Ben argues you pick a side.  No has Pauline Hanson and Andrew Bolt.  Yes has Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson.

Which side are you on?

Plus Ben touches on why the noise around the Rockingham by-election is meaningless Liberal narrative and why Dutton's abysmal record on government contracts is best left to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to determine.

Hundreds have already added their voice to the growing opposition to Macquarie University's censorship of the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) club because of our anti-war, socialist perspective. The IYSSE is the only youth and student movement internationally which is seeking to end the US-NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine and the US-led war drive against China which threaten a catastrophic nuclear third world war. University management is seeking to prevent students and young people from encountering such a perspective amid the global capitalist crisis which is driving many youth to left-wing and revolutionary politics.

ü¶ú More than 399 million birds, like the critically endangered night parrot
ü¶é More than 609 million reptiles, like the vulnerable great desert skink
üíî Overall they kill 2 billion animals. A devastating annual toll. 

Many animals and reptile species can't take much more of this assault. Already, cats have driven 25 unique Aussie animals to extinction and threaten the survival of 120 more.

We must act now to protect what is unique and wondrous about Australia. The chance to save our animals is now. If we miss it, it may be too late.

The Health Services Union (HSU) in NSW has won a pay rise of up to 8.5% for its lowest paid members and Ben explains how this union has tackled the issue of low paid ""essential workers"" and won.

The Commonwealth has also announced changes to teacher education over the next two years so Ben has a look at why that's happened, why we need to fix the Morrison era funding set ups and what impact it has on productivity.

As the proud son of migrants who worked hard to build a life here, I can see the challenges faced by those from our cultural and linguistically diverse communities, to truly explore the idea of reconciliation and the need for a Voice to Parliament.

It is therefore incumbent on all of us to engage all members of our communities in dialogue about how profound our 75,000 year history is. In understanding who we are, where we‚Äôve been and where we could go, we can then walk alongside each other on a path to a stronger, more united country.

775512974306667,137377391864,Environment Centre NT,,,"Only 15 years ago Lee Point was a place for us, the community.

It is public land and before 2009 it was zoned for Public Use and Recreation.

Now, federally listed threatened species like the Gouldian Finch and Black-footed tree rats, 300 year old woolly butt trees, the last remaining savanna corridor to Darwin and a spot beloved by thousands from Larrakia people to twitchers across the globe is due to be bulldozed.

 It's due to be bulldozed because a Territory politician decided to sign an agreement with  a Federal Statutory body in 2016 for commercial housing. (Commercial housing unsuited to a tropical climate, paid for by the public, on public land and with the majority being sold for a profit.)

Since that agreement was signed behind closed doors, Lee Point's fate was politically sealed.

Ever since then, the cracks in our planning and environmental laws locally and federally have been revealed as massive gaping holes.

There are no adequate laws to protect what is naturally and culturally valuable. 

The community, made up of traditional owners, scientists, families, doctors, lawyers, bird watchers, and lee point lovers alike, have worked tirelessly to have their voice heard.

Our political and legal system has no genuine mechanism to hear the community's voice.

Our strongest option left is to get creative and yell even louder.

We all know, in the Territory particularly, the power of the community taking a stand is the strongest power we have. 

Friends of Lee Point will be hosting a vigil everyday at Lee Point from 5.30pm.

The model proposed for the Voice to Parliament is not a ‚Äúmodest change‚Äù, nor is it ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù.  It is a major change that has no detail and that would be permanent.
There is no indication of how the Voice will make practical changes to underprivileged Indigenous people, and the country‚Äôs best legal minds are divided on what the High Court will be called to adjudicate on.
It is not true that a majority of Indigenous people support this - in Northern Queensland, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are saying that the Voice can‚Äôt properly represent the diverse needs and views of the many different communities.

Ben Davison takes a look at the big stories coming out of Russia, the Musk/Zuckerberg cage match and the Oceangate tragedy and draws together the threads of how these sagas, created and caused by billionaires, usually involve the suffering and or exploitation of working people. And that maybe that's why there's a level of skepticism towards them.

Ben also discusses the passing of the referendum bill, the decision by Lidia Thorpe to support the NO case and breaks down the three different, equally bad, arguments for voting NO.  Remembering that a referendum is a binary choice and that only a YES vote moves reconciliation forward.

Julie Collins, Minister for Housing, was on Insiders and she tore apart the Greens political party's position on housing.  Revealing that the delay to the Housing Affordability Future Fund also delayed $200,000,000 in repairs and maintenance on regional and remote Indigenous housing, that rent freezes REDUCE supply of housing and that the Commonwealth is working with the states but cannot legally direct them.

Ben also answers a listeners question about trans rights and responds to a listener and Maritime Union of Australia - MUA member from Sydney Ferries.

Meet Thomas Mayo.

He's a member of the PM's Referendum Working Group.

He signed off on the words Labor wants to put into our Constitution.

He wrote the handbook to the Voice to Parliament and is one of the 'YES' campaign's leading public advocates.

The PM argues on repeat that the Voice is a ""modest request"" from Indigenous Australians.

But Thomas Mayo said it will be used to ""punish politicians"", ""abolish colonialist institutions"" and ""pay the rent"", which means ""reparations and compensation"".

He said ""there is nothing that we can do that is more powerful than building a first nations' Voice, a black institution, a black political force to be reckoned with"".

At a 2021 Invasion Day protest he said he was ""sick of governments not listening to our voice"" so planned ""to use the rulebook of the nation to force them"".

Over the coming weeks, Victorian Socialists volunteers will be out and about across Melbourne talking to residents about how we can ensure our city and local communities work for everyone, not just the wealthy few.

We think that today, increasingly, they don't, and that this is due to the sacrifice of basic human needs to the pursuit of private profit‚Äîa sacrifice in which the major parties have, over many decades, been complicit.

The housing crisis is perhaps the clearest and most immediate aspect of this, but that crisis can't be understood in isolation from the broader dynamics of this profit-driven system.

Victorians Socialists believe it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. It‚Äôs ordinary people that make our cities and communities run, not the occupants of high political offices and corporate boardrooms. It‚Äôs us, not them, that should run the city.

Were this to happen, our priorities would be very different to those pursued by big business and their representatives in government today. We could create a city for people, not profit.

Victorian Socialists want to be part of that. We want to help bring together all those concerned with the state of our cities and communities and start to give voice to a vision of how things could be different from the profit-driven status quo.

To kick this off, we want to hear from you! We've put together a survey (https://victoriansocialists.org.au/campaigns/housing-crisis) to help us better understand the reality of the housing crisis and other problems people are facing, and to find out residents' views on the most urgent priorities for action.

Then, on Saturday 15th July at 2pm at Trades Hall in Carlton we'll be hosting a public forum (Fighting for a city for people not profit), where we'll discuss what we've found, and hear form a panel of speakers about what a city built around human need, rather than profit, might look like.",Not a Voice Ad

Van Badham and Ben Davison explore the broken philosophy of The RBA that denies profiteering is a problem until everyone else has said it is, continues to believe in a wage-price spiral that doesn't exist and both simultaneously says people should get more work but we need less people employed.  

Of course the union movement was among the first to point out the fallacies of the RBA's ideology and continues to win better pay and conditions so join at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben and Van also examine how Japan's monetary policy is structured and the outcomes that can be achieved when the high priests of Milton Friedman are no longer in charge.

The Greens have delayed the Housing Affordability Future Fund until at least October.  

Ben and Van look at the arguments, break down the math and try to get a better understanding whether it is politicking or ignorance that is driving The Greens to upend millions of dollars in social housing funding.

The referendum legislation has passed parliament meaning that the government must call a referendum within six months.  Van and Ben discuss the campaign so far, the work being done for a big national YES day on July 2nd and offer solidarity to those being attacked by the billionaire and corporate owned media for daring to have a Voice.

The good news is that despite the misinformation and vast corporate media NO machine the YES vote is ahead.  Ben and Van look at some polling, some analysis and give their views.

You can become a supporter at www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday and while you're there send us a question for Ben to answer on the Weekend Wrap this Sunday.

Later this year, Australians will be able to vote at a referendum and complete our Constitution.

A successful YES vote will recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the Constitution and create a voice to help close the gap.

Despite being one of the most successful nations in the world, on too many measures, our Indigenous brothers and sisters are not sharing the same outcomes as other Australians:

¬∑ The life expectancy of an Indigenous Australian is eight years below that of other Australians.  

¬∑ The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is estimated to be about 9 times higher than their fellow Australians.

¬∑ One in five Indigenous households are living in accommodation that does not meet an acceptable standard.

¬∑ The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is almost two and half times that of other Australians, and

¬∑ Young Indigenous males are more likely to end up in jail, than attending a university.

By writing YES we can help change this.

The Voice is a practical change that will help local and regional communities across Australia.

I will be supporting the YES case because it is a safe constitutional change, and it will make a meaningful difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander Australians.

Over the months ahead, I am looking forward to being part of a movement of Australians from all political backgrounds and playing a part in a campaign that will bring our country together.",Is a Voice ad

Because of the need to find a niche in an oversaturated media landscape, many young political and journalism professionals are pushed into selling themselves as a bi resource. I get it. This strategy makes perfect sense if you happen to be bisexual. As the saying goes, write about what you know. The problem is that once you‚Äôre established as a voice on such a narrow topic, how do you remain interesting? How many times can a person write an article about biphobia or bi-erasure before readers and publishers demand something new? The competitive marketplace of ideas incentivizes people to embrace increasingly radical positions. That‚Äôs how a simple idea like ‚Äòsupport same-sex marriage‚Äô [d]evolves into the edgier ‚Äòdismantle the entire concept of marriage because it‚Äôs a heteronormative construct.‚Äô Despite being one of these ‚Äòprofessional bis‚Äô myself, I feel compelled to point out that this race to stay relevant is a dangerous game. It is backfiring on the LGBT community by alienating those who would otherwise be our allies.

‚ÄúI stumbled into ‚Äòbi activism‚Äô accidentally via the LA social scene. My wife, Talia, and I moved from Ashland, Oregon to downtown Los Angeles, where she was pursuing her Masters at USC film school. Neither of us had many friends in the city, so we joined a social club called amBi. At the time, amBi was a local meetup group for bi people in the LA area. Talia knew I was bi, but she identified as straight. Fortunately, the club‚Äôs website made it clear that you don‚Äôt have to be bisexual to join. It clearly stated that ‚Äòpartners and allies‚Äô were welcome. We attended a few events, including a Bi Talent Show at the LA LGBT Center. We quickly made a lot of friends, and our lack-of-an-LA-social-life issue was soon behind us.‚Äù -@rio_veradonir @ambisocial

They unloaded their precious cargo and embarked on a challenging trek through the jungle, following the pastor. Hours passed until they reached their destination, where a gathering of excited local Christians awaited. The joy and gratitude were immeasurable.

Sure, we all know about it but I can guarantee that the CRPD is not top of mind for my sister as she goes about her daily cup of tea, day program, bus trip and set nightly tv viewing schedule.

However, the UN CRPD is there and so far this week I have been struck at how truly foundational it is in our every day lives and in the work of Down Syndrome NSW. 

So too, I have been enthused by the collaborative nature of our government and non government colleagues who have gathered here to advocate, share and learn. 

As I sit here in the General Assembly writing this, I am listening to a plea from the Chair of the UN CRPD Committee that has left me amazed (and infuriated) that many countries are yet to sign up to the UN CRPD.

The opportunity to be representing our loved ones with Down syndrome and intellectual disability and their families is not lost on me. I am proud to give a voice to many who may not have a voice but have so much to say.

With opportunity comes responsibility and it is for this reason that I am writing this commentary to our community. In doing so, my hope is multifaceted ‚Äì to inform, to engage, to have our members feel like they too are here at the UN because they are.

This year, we have the opportunity to make history. A once-in-a-generation chance to change our nation, and change it for the better.

As your local MP, I've created a group on Facebook as a central location for information, campaigning, and events for the Far North Coast (link at bottom of post). 

This group is a place for locals to join together and make history. I'll be sharing important updates and events, as well as support - including my Community Care Van, materials and more - to make it happen. It's also a place for you to share your own community events and spread the word - this group is for locals interested in the Voice to get involved and make it happen. 

Please also feel free to sign up for updates and volunteering on my website: justineelliot.com.au/supportthevoice if you're interested in helping out. 

We'll have plenty to do, so let's make history together... and see you in the group! ‚ù§üñ§üíõ

We all have a role to play in reconciliation and our everyday actions matter. We want to build a future where the voices of children just like these little ones are heard, valued and amplified. 

Here are a few tangible ways you can #BeAVoice for #Reconciliation for the next generation:

‚ú® Be a voice for listening: Protect the space for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices to be heard.

‚ú® Be a voice for representation: Learn about the history of representative bodies and calls for treaty. Listen to the calls, debates and discussions by First Peoples on treaties, constitutional reform, and Voice to Parliament. 

‚ú® Be a voice for unity: Connect with your local Traditional Custodians, amplify their voices and collaborate with local reconciliation groups.

‚ú® Be a voice for learning: Speak up to ensure that our children learn about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and history in schools.

Let's keep up the momentum of change beyond #ReconciliationWeek. Together, we can make a difference every day.

ü¶ú More than 399 million birds, like the critically endangered night parrot
ü¶é More than 609 million reptiles, like the vulnerable great desert skink
üíî Overall they kill 2 billion animals. A devastating annual toll. 

Many animals and reptile species can't take much more of this assault. Already, cats have driven 25 unique Aussie animals to extinction and threaten the survival of 120 more.

We must act now to protect what is unique and wondrous about Australia. The chance to save our animals is now. If we miss it, it may be too late.

Van Badham and Ben Davison are BACK and the struggle continues! Visy, Australia's largest private company, is still refusing to make a decent offer to workers after 20 weeks of action and bosses in the university sector are strategising together to cut pay and conditions while bosses unions are calling for cuts to the minimum wage and the right to keep exploiting sham contracting and labour hire loopholes.

Van and Ben take a look at how sham contracting in the gig economy, labour hire across multiple industries and forced casualisation has undermined wages and conditions.  Ben and Van look at how workers, in union, are campaigning for same job, same pay laws, rights for platform based workers in the NDIS, aged care and transport sectors as well as an end to the loopholes that allow BHP to own a labour hire company it then uses to engage workers in their mines to do the same work but for LESS pay.  

You can stand up for your job and your wages by joining your union at australianunions.org.au/wow 

Ben hits a classic rant about the greedflation spiral, Phil Lowe's high priests of Monetary Policy and why it is time to stop listening to incompetent Australian executives and start believing our own eyes when it comes to economics. 

The Albanese Labor government wants to see more Australian content on Australian screens with proposed laws to make sure streaming services invest here, where they are making their profits.  Van talks about why Aussie stories on Aussie screens is so important.

Plus The Voice is a step closer, despite the misinformation campaigns online.

And good news from one of our staunch supporters about the CSIRO and Hydrogen!

Ben admits he couldn't bring himself to watch Insiders as he gives a scathing critique of the Murdoch infiltration of the ABC.  On a week where Stan Grant was hounded out of QandA by Murdoch's dogs, the Uluru statement from the Heart had its anniversary and The Australian admitted to doctoring a letter to the editor about Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson there was an Australian journalist on the Insiders panel.  Who didn't talk about ANY of those issues.

Lidia Thorpe continues to not understand how a referendum works by no claiming she'll abstain from the binary YES or NO vote on the Voice.

Liberals in the senate used their time to continue to platform ideas from Steve Bannon, anti-vaxers, the nuclear lobby and far right ""fathers"" groups while wasting time on the fashion choices of public servants.  In NSW they chose between the loser of Gilmore and the loser of Parramatta to fill a casual senate vacancy.  The loser of Parramatta was chosen.

Meanwhile in the real world more Australian's are trapped in sham contracting and its costing thousands of dollars per worker per year and millions in retirement.  Australian Unions and The Centre for Future Work have research that shows in the NDIS, Aged Care and transport platforms are being used to make people into sham contractors but that it doesn't have to be that way.

Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti aka Fela An√≠k√∫l√°p√≥ Kuti was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, musician, singer, composer, bandleader, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. The pioneer of Afrobeat, as well as a voice for the people. Fela, coming from a family of prominent influencers, was destined for greatness. His mother was an anti-colonial feminist that led the Abeokuta Women‚Äôs riots in the 1940s.  His father  was an Anglican minister, as well as the president of the Nigerian Union of Teachers. Fela‚Äôs cousin, Wole Soyinka, is a well-known writer and Nobel Peace Prize winner for literature (the first  Sub-Saharan African to win the award). 

Kuti‚Äôs start in music began in the late 1950s. He was sent abroad to London where he was meant to study medicine, but ended up shifting to study music instead. He mastered many instruments from the trumpet, electric guitar, drums, saxophone, and piano. He put together a band known as Africa 70 (later on renamed Egypt 80) and toured the globe. Kuti was known for extravagant stage performances and powerful societal messaging. Speaking out against the Nigerian military, tyrannical government, and the harsh treatment of the Nigerian people. Fela coined his music style as Afrobeat, a musical fusion highlife, traditional Yoruba music, funk, jazz, and soul. He credits his drummer and musical director Tony Oladipo Allen as being a major player in the creation of Afrobeat. 

Kuti‚Äôs legacy is cemented. He will forever be celebrated and adored for the contributions he made to the African people. For generations to come üá≥üá¨

The Greens political party once again is teaming up with the Liberals, Nationals and Pauline Hanson‚Äôs One Nation to block Labor‚Äôs multi-billion-dollar efforts to fix the nation‚Äôs housing crisis.

Labor‚Äôs $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund is the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a decade, but the Greens are stopping it - along with help from the Liberals, Nationals, and Pauline Hanson's One Nation.

Because the Greens refuse to support this legislation, they‚Äôre directly delaying 30,000 new social and affordable homes for Australians in need.

It‚Äôs disgraceful that, while locals are living in cars, and women and children fleeing domestic violence have nowhere to go, local candidate Mandy Nolan and her Greens party colleagues are playing political games.

As the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, I‚Äôm on the ground speaking to locals who desperately need this Bill passed. Our community is appalled that parties in our Parliament, including the Greens, are blocking it.

The Greens have a disgraceful history in teaming up with the Liberals and Nationals‚Äì like blocking the carbon pollution reduction scheme (with Tony Abbott), limiting access to the aged pension (with Malcolm Turnbull), and stopping locals accessing affordable housing (with Peter Dutton).

In contrast, I‚Äôm proud to be your strong voice in the Albanese Labor Government. We had our Prime Minister here on the North Coast again just last week to talk real results - like cheaper childcare, more bulk-billing, and increases in rent assistance.

This is what action looks like and I‚Äôm proud to be your strong voice in the Albanese Labor Government that actually delivers.",Not a Voice Ad

Ben Davison looks at the first 12 months of the Albanese Labor government and some of the big changes ranging from the National Anti-Corruption Commission and Robo-debt royal commission to improvements in job security and wages to NDIS reforms and genuine action on climate change.  The first year of Labor at a national level has achieved a lot.

The union movement has had successes on wages, women's participation in the workforce, job security, the energy transition authority and improvements to the social wage.  join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben also takes a look at why media is obsessed with the negatives.  The Voice is a classic example where two polls released in the same week get very different treatment by the media.  Ben explains how this empowers the fringe elements and the impact that has on people, such as Stan Grant's announcement, and our political system.

The Liberal's in Victoria continue to want a party leader that will embrace hatred and defend Nazism with the state conference in Bendigo marred by walkouts, booing and cries of ""shame"" as Menzian Liberal leader John Pesutto took the stage.

Ben asks the question, if we want more progress on #education, #healthcare, #NDIS, tax reform and #climate change do we really think the Liberals will deliver it better than Labor?

üõë What can we do? Here are some crucial steps we need to take:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Raise Awareness: Share this post and spread the word to ensure that no one remains uninformed. Knowledge is the first step towards action!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Educate Yourself: Learn to recognize the signs of child abuse and neglect. By understanding the indicators, we can intervene and protect vulnerable children in our communities.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Report Suspected Abuse: If you witness or suspect child abuse, it is our responsibility to report it immediately to the appropriate authorities. Let's prioritize the safety and well-being of our children above all else.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Support Organisations: Contribute your time, resources, or funds to local organizations working tirelessly to prevent child abuse and support survivors. Together, we can make a difference!

5Ô∏è‚É£ Be a Supportive Listener: Encourage open conversations about child abuse. By lending a compassionate ear, we can help survivors heal and foster a safe space for them to share their experiences.

üíô Remember, every child deserves to be loved, protected, and given a chance to thrive. It's time to break the cycle of abuse and create a safer future for generations to come.

Let us stand united against child abuse in Australia! Share, spread the message, and let your voice be heard. Together, we can build a brighter and safer tomorrow for our children. üí™üåü

She desperately does not want the proposed Chalumbin wind development to go ahead.

Today she shared a dream unfinished:

""The wind turbines got in the way and started popping up everywhere, all over Country. Even though I was asleep I could feel myself getting emotional anger over what I was seeing.  There are tears for my Country.  I woke up. I could feel my ancestors telling me to paint pictures to tell my strong dream. 

Save our future, save our cultural heritage and the natural living world.  Water is the source for the living. Water is more precious than gold. The feathers represent the birdlife that live on Jirrbal country.""

The most important thing you can do after sending in your own submission is to encourage other people and organisations to do the same.

Submissions play a critical role in the Committee recommending a permanent ban of waterbird shooting, and the Government then following this recommendation and legislating the ban in Parliament.

It is critical to not only increase the number of submissions supporting a ban, but to ensure submissions address a wide variety of issues including:

‚Ä¢Community values and perspective;
‚Ä¢Cultural, social and recreational aspects;
‚Ä¢Sustainability, environmental and animal welfare aspects of native bird hunting;
‚Ä¢Economic considerations;
‚Ä¢Perspectives of First Nations;
‚Ä¢How native bird hunting is managed in other jurisdictions; and
‚Ä¢Any other issue relevant to duck shooting

Do you know people or organisations who feel passionately that this barbaric sport should end? Or are impacted by duck shooting each year in relation to the issues above? 

If we all commit to asking 5 people and 2 organisations, even if just a few of the people you ask write submissions, think of how many more submissions supporting a ban they will receive. 

By working together we can finally secure a permanent ban to this immense suffering.  
.
.
.
Any individual or organisation wishing to make a written submission to the Committee, or register an interest in presenting oral evidence to the Committee, is invited to do so by Friday, 19 May 2023. 

Written submissions and expressions of interest should be addressed to the Secretary to the Committee, C/- Parliament House, GPO Box 572, Adelaide 5001, or emailed to scnativebirds@parliament.sa.gov.au

Van Badham and Ben Davison take a deep dive on the ideological frameworks that have crafted the first Commonwealth budget surplus in 15 years while also delivering increases to wages, Jobseeker, parenting payments, rent assistance and massive investments in health, Medicare and aged care.

The budget doesn't deliver everything everyone wants and Ben and Van explain how and why some of the decisions, both popular and unpopular, have their roots in Keynesian economics which, after 40 years of neoliberalism, is not something everyone instantly recognises.

Australian Unions has had some big wins in this budget for jobs, wages, energy transition, TAFE and much more.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

There is also great news for the environment with the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency and big investments in our national parks and waterways.  

Plus real commitments to the arts, the Voice, breaking the artificial ""caps"" imposed under Morrisonism and beginning to rebuild our public services, needs based education and NDIS.

In line with the State Government‚Äôs election commitment, on 9 March 2023 the Legislative Council formed a Committee to inquire into the hunting of native waterbirds.  

The Committee is now calling for submissions. 

Submissions play a critical role in the Committee recommending a permanent ban of waterbird shooting, and the Government then following this recommendation and legislating the ban in Parliament.

The Committee will consider a range of issues related to the shooting of waterbirds, with particular reference to: 

‚Ä¢Community values and perspective;
‚Ä¢Cultural, social and recreational aspects;
‚Ä¢Sustainability, environmental and animal welfare aspects of native bird hunting;
‚Ä¢Economic considerations;
‚Ä¢Perspectives of First Nations;
‚Ä¢How native bird hunting is managed in other jurisdictions; and
‚Ä¢Any other relevant matter

Any individual or organisation wishing to make a written submission to the Committee, or register an interest in presenting oral evidence to the Committee, is invited to do so by Friday, 19 May 2023. 

Written submissions and expressions of interest should be addressed to the Secretary to the Committee, C/- Parliament House, GPO Box 572, Adelaide 5001, or emailed to scnativebirds@parliament.sa.gov.au

Please note that it is extremely important to write submissions that are unique and personal - if the Committee feels that the same submission has been submitted multiple times, it will be treated like a petition and will significantly reduce the impact of your submission. 

Please also note the importance of addressing a wide variety of issues that relate to waterbird shooting. The suffering inflicted on waterbirds is of course a significant issue, but the greater the diversity of issues raised, addressed, demonstrated and supported by evidence, the more likely the committee will see no other option but to vote for a permanent ban of waterbird shooting. Addressing even just one of these issues will be extremely helpful, there is no need to address all of them unless you want to.

When she first came into Barnardos care, Taylor had suffered such trauma that it left her mute. Worse yet, her 3-year-old little brother Kai* was also mute, and both have been diagnosed with PTSD.

They had been found wandering the streets near their home, hardly clothed, Kai in just a dirty nappy. They were taken to hospital where Taylor was treated for ringworm and a bad lung infection, and both were found to be seriously malnourished. We suspect that Taylor has also experienced significant developmental delays.

Thanks to the kindness of Barnardos supporters, Taylor and Kai are now safe and living with one of our amazing foster carers. 
But they have a very long road ahead, if they are to recover from their traumatic early start and go on to live their brightest future.

She desperately does not want the proposed Chalumbin wind development to go ahead.

Today she shared a dream unfinished:

""The wind turbines got in the way and started popping up everywhere, all over Country. Even though I was asleep I could feel myself getting emotional anger over what I was seeing.  There are tears for my Country.  I woke up. I could feel my ancestors telling me to paint pictures to tell my strong dream. 

Save our future, save our cultural heritage and the natural living world.  Water is the source for the living. Water is more precious than gold. The feathers represent the birdlife that live on Jirrbal country.""

David Jackson, KC, Australia‚Äôs pre-eminent constitutional law barrister, said: ‚ÄúIt would mean we become a nation where ‚Ä¶ we are not all equal.‚Äù Nicholas Hasluck, KC, submitted that the proposal would create ‚Äú[a] profound and essentially irreversible change to the structure of government [which] is contrary to democratic ideals reflected in the Constitution‚Äù, and Terry Cole, KC, wrote that its inclusion in the Constitution would provide ‚Äúthe potential for great, irredeemable harm to Australian society‚Äù.‚Äô",Is a Voice ad

What is happening?
How can we help?

Political conflicts often arise for unknown reasons around the world, and civilians bear the brunt of the consequences. Sudan, a country already struggling with poor economic and humanitarian conditions, is currently experiencing violent clashes between the official army and an armed militia. The conflict has disproportionately affected people with disabilities and special needs, who have long faced difficulty integrating into society and accessing adequate care resources.

During the clashes‚Äô, disabled individuals were unable to evacuate from conflict zones and were killed alongside hundreds of others. Additionally, over 250,000 people, including many with special needs, were forced to flee to neighbouring countries. Infinite Support, a humanitarian organization with expertise in caring for people with disabilities, believes that it is their duty to support and aid those with disabilities and special needs among the Sudanese population.

We, at Infinite Support, are always ready to liaise with organisations, whether through ideas or implementation of any support we can provide. We have staff who are already donating belongings and necessities, our marketing team are arranging partnerships with local organisations to provide financial aid. 

If you would like to contribute in any way, please contact us on
admin@infinite.support.com.au or 0414 922 768.

We believe that we are very lucky with the many experiences, over the long years of work with all types of disabilities and special needs which is now allowing for us to advocate and support those whos‚Äô voice are not being heard.

Van Badham and Ben Davison discuss the Reserve Bank's guerrilla interest rate rise, budget leaks and what they might mean for you as well as the minimum wage and why unions are taking action against the people who'd pay you nothing if they could get away with it. So join Australian Unions at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben breaks down the incoherence of the reserve banks ideological attack on working people and the government we all elected.

Van looks at how targeted budget programs can improve living standards and why it is a good thing to tax fossil fuel companies.

Plus there's a look at some key news for working people involving universities, Qantas and the minimum wage.

Plus thanks to MC Robbie Buck, singer Cassidy Joan for fabulous live music, Auslan interpreter Rebecca Cramp, and Mayor Mark Greenhill for cohosting this event with me.

Van Badham joins Ben Davison for a special weekend wrap! They dissect David Speers' on defence policy, consider #insiders decision to ignore reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), ask whether Albo attending the Sandilands wedding was either good or bad politics and the dangers of mistaking online abuse for a real-world movement.

Our hosts discuss what real reforms to the social safety net would look like, and how media needs to be careful not to fall into the traps that right-wing media are now tangled in when reporting on policy reforms to the NDIS, unemployment and housing.

They also cover Australian Unions using May Day to campaign for The Voice, with Sally McManus and Michele O'Neil on the ground in the ""soft"" states of Queensland and South Australia. This comes on the back of polling showing that YES would win the referendum if it were held today.... so, join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben and Van also discuss the announced reforms to migration, the improved protections for workers, the uplift in regulation in the sector and how Labor is facing down vested interests to deliver needed skills as well as opportunity for people to make Australia their home while contributing to our commonwealth.

‚ÄùI believe that youth and adolescents have what it takes to advocate for their health rights. My desire to see health disparity gaps between well-established and vulnerable communities reduced is what made me apply for the opportunity to volunteer with #IAHW, help with the advocacy for adolescent and youth health rights and services, and influence positive change on the healthcare system. 

I have been able to do a series of meetings to educate people on issues affecting adolescent health through Google Meet. I have also been able to sensitize the public through radio station interview sessions during the #IAHW2023.

If I were leader of my country, I would ensure that there were regular assessments of healthcare centers so that they know their health needs and levels and can ensure resources are distributed equitably. I would ensure corruption is eliminated in healthcare so that all awarded funds reach the communities in need. I would also foster a multidisciplinary planning of healthcare and ensure grassroot youth-led organizations help in planning for adolescent and youth health.‚Äù

Fill in the survey to contribute to the Australian Liveability Census - an online survey that captures community values and factors that impact quality of life.

Complete the survey here: https://placescore.org/lc23_do_nsw_lanecove

In 2021, Lane Cove's score was the equal highest score across the nation! Tied with Adelaide, our score was well above the national average. 

The results showed us that our strengths are a sense of personal safety; local businesses that provide for daily needs; elements of the natural environment; landscaping/natural elements; access to neighbourhood amenities; and a sense of belonging in the community.

The 2023 project will see over 60 councils, state agencies, non-profits, corporations, and research organisations unite for this ground-breaking study on liveability. The research aims to uncover the key factors that impact quality of life for Australians, and how governments can prioritise planning that leads to better outcomes.

The Australian Liveability Census asks participants to consider all the attributes of a great neighbourhood ‚Äì social, economic, cultural and physical. What is more important to you ‚Äì local shops or more car parking? More trees or things to do in the evening? We know every community is different and this is a chance for everyone to have their say.

By completing the survey, you not only ensure your voice is heard in shaping the future of Australian neighbourhoods, but there are also 50 x $100 vouchers to be won.

Population expansionists can only visualize the dollars signs in vastly increasing housing supply... there's money to be made in property, bucket loads of it. Build! build! build! is their agenda. Not a thought for those they destroy or displace, after all, they are not human, they (apparently) have no rights, no say in all this- they do not vote, they cannot apply for bank loans or pay rent... they are dispensable in the bigger game!

Taking the pressure out of the demand for housing via greatly reduced immigration intakes and a stabilizing of our population, is definitely not a part of their business model.

But is there enough humanity left in the rest of us to consider those without a voice, those who cannot speak- those who seek only a place to live, as they have done for millions of years? Who will stand up for them?

SPA says- Let us not forget our wildlife. Let us not allow them just to be sacrificed to the property moguls.
Let us all stand up for our creatures, great and small, as united Australians. Let's do it, if for no other reason than that it is what's morally & ethically right. 

No amount of money can buy that feeling morality generates. Let's do this for them, and we guarantee that from this new ethical base, everything else will begin to sort itself out.

Add your voice to our Native Forest Declaration, calling for urgent protection of Australia‚Äôs native forests and their wildlife, knowing that:

üåø The climate and biodiversity crisis are inextricably linked.

üåø Many Australian birds that depend on forests face extinction this century.

üåø Koalas, greater gliders, wombats and quolls are among the many animals killed by logging.

üåø Logging increases bushfire risks.

üåø Forests are irreplaceable carbon banks, but, when logged and burnt, emit megatonnes of greenhouse gases.

üåø Australia has more than enough plantations to meet its wood needs.

Invasive species have contributed to a whopping 75% of Australia‚Äôs extinctions, and they STILL imperil at LEAST another 123 threatened species. The CSIRO says that invasive species are Australia‚Äôs top threat, compared to overseas where invasive species are in the top 5 threats.

Dealing with invasive species must be a national priority if we want our bush to be the Australian bush, not one overtaken by weeds, diseases, European pests like rabbits or where predators like feral cats kill 2 BILLION native animals each year üò°

Macquarie Island is a clear reminder that we can spark a wildlife revival - but only if we choose native wildlife over invasives.

Will the decisions I make today create a better future for my children and children throughout Townsville, Palm Island and Australia? This is the question I ask myself everyday. 
Will The Voice create a better future for Aboriginal children facing significant challenges right now?
Will The Voice put an end to children as young as 4 smoking marijuana? 
Will The Voice stop the 5 year old who was sexually assaulted by a family member with the child returned to the perpetrator because the authorities don‚Äôt want to remove an aboriginal child from their Aboriginal family? That child is at risk right now. 
Will The Voice stop the high incarceration rates?
Will The Voice bring us together as a nation? 
Will The Voice stop domestic violence?

So, I do not support The Voice. 
The Aboriginal people in my family and the many I‚Äôve spoken to in the community and around the country do not support the voice.

I am committed to creating a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people. From the ground up, I support a local and regional body that represents them, working with Elders and the grass roots people in the community. Let‚Äôs work together on being solutions focused.
If you can‚Äôt get local governance right, you won‚Äôt get it right nationally. We need local and regional bodies.

Our politicians will soon be voting on changes to guardianship in Tasmania.  They can give Tasmanians a fighting chance to defend themselves against an unfair system that strips people of their human rights. 

We are calling on Tasmanian Lower House Members to improve The Guardianship and Administration Amendment Bill 2023 that was tabled in parliament last week.  This is because in its current form, the Amendment Bill does not provide any effective means to protect Tasmanians. 

Tasmanians deserve to have their human rights front and centre with greater transparency and accountability. With the changes we have outlined Tasmanians will at least have a fighting chance to protect their rights until a supported decision making system is in place.

Tasmania can lead the nation with these reforms! If successful, they will have a flow on effect across the country.

The Voice will impact people all over Australia, from the ACTüèûÔ∏è to the Northern Territory‚òÄÔ∏è. What we do and how we vote in Murrumbidgee will have a ripple effect, it matters.

Over the coming months I will be spending time in the community talking to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples about the proposed Voice to Parliament, and sharing those chats with you all üëã

To kick-off this series last week, I met with Senator for the Northern Territory and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy - Northern Territory to discuss what a Voice means for Australia and why a strong ‚ÄúYes‚Äù vote is so important. 

Always was, always will be.

‚ù∂ impose sanctions on Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE),
‚ù∑ impose a complete ban on US companies operating in any aspect of Myanmar's gas industry, including services, finance, and insurance,
‚ù∏ impose sanctions on international Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE)‚Äôs bank accounts, and 
‚ùπ work with allies such as the UK, EU, Canada, and Australia to impose similar sanctions as far as their legislation allows.

As this is a global movement! We are calling on everyone inside Myanmar, and Myanmar diasporas around the world to join our call either online or on the ground, public protest, march and rally.

In light of the Queensland State Government‚Äôs $2.7 billion demolition and reconstruction of the Gabba Stadium for the 2032 Olympics, the East Brisbane State School community has been informed that their much-loved school will be closed indefinitely, or relocated to Coorparoo. This will mean that there will be no state primary school in East Brisbane, Kangaroo Point or Woolloongabba.

The Queensland State Government has released a survey but the options have been deemed unacceptable by the school community. East Brisbane State School P & C Association has created a parallel survey with additional options, including the option of building a new school within the current catchment.

To complete the survey, click on the link below and fill out the survey online. All comments will be read by the P&C committee and results of the survey will be shared publicly to illustrate community voice and concerns. No personally identifying information will be stored or shared.

The Senate is conducting an inquiry into bank closures in regional Australia, and this is a huge step in the right direction.

Our party campaigned hard for this inquiry because we saw the devastating impact that branch closures were having.

Small businesses and their customers lose access to cash. Vulnerable customers lose the certainty and security of face-to-face banking, forced to bank online where they are the primary targets of sophisticated scammers. Towns lose money as their residents who have to travel to larger centres to do their banking also spend their shopping dollars there.

More than 300 branches have closed in the last two years. Many towns have lost their last bank. The banks claim they‚Äôre only responding to people banking online but it‚Äôs a lie. The inquiry has already heard evidence that banks are forcing customers online, by harassing them to register and removing the branch services.

The Big Four banks are making obscenely high profits in part because of free money they get from the Term Funding Facility. 
The banks are on the public dole, and they repay the people with a knife in the back.

Macquarie Island is now pest free after a seven year project to eradicate all the invasive cats, rats, mice, and rabbits.

Invasive species have contributed to a whopping 75% of Australia‚Äôs extinctions, and they STILL imperil at LEAST another 123 threatened species. The CSIRO says that invasive species are Australia‚Äôs top threat, compared to overseas where invasive species are in the top 5 threats.

Dealing with invasive species must be a national priority if we want our bush to be the Australian bush, not one overtaken by weeds, diseases, European pests like rabbits or where predators like feral cats kill 2 BILLION native animals each year üò°

Van Badham and Ben Davison return home from their award winning run at the Adelaide Fringe Festival to discuss the NSW State Election, on March 25th, the issues, the leaders, the optional preferential system and the seats to watch.  It is looking like a tight election but if NSW wants, as the polls are suggesting they do, guaranteed minimum staffing levels in hospitals, public schools that have resources for every student, wages that are going up and leadership that's focused on the issues that matter to everyday people then Labor should win. 

Of course Unions NSW and the many affiliate unions that are made up of workers in sectors cut, smashed and abandoned by Perrottet's Liberals are campaigning and you can become a union member to protect your rights at work, whatever state you are in, at australianunions.org.au/wow 

In Victoria we suffered through a TERF-Nazi joint rally on the weekend.  Van explains how TERFs are NOT feminists, are a vocal EXTREMIST minority and that Liberal MPs and Senators defending those associated with these individuals are putting a toxic set of values into our political discourse.  Van and Ben offer their solidarity to members of the Trans community and all minority groups who would have, understandably, been concerned by the scenes over the weekend.

The Voice is a step closer with the machinery of the referendum set to pass the parliament.  The laws on how to run the referendum needed updating given we haven't had a referendum since the invention of social media!

And there is good environmental news about the capturing of carbon which may or may not being able to supply every home with enough baking soda to ensure no fridge is ever smelly again!

Van also acknowledges our Cadre and Extend the Reach Supporters who have gone to www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday and helped us grow our audience.

233483732491021,148410063174,MS Australia,,,"Many of us know someone affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) ‚Äì a friend, a family member, a colleague or a personal diagnosis.

MS is the most commonly acquired chronic neurological disease affecting young adults and affects three times more women than men in Australia. 

As yet, there is no cure.

Many people living with MS who require support from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) find the scheme fails to meet their needs. 

Inadequate disability support for people who rely on it forces considerable pain and distress on the person and their loved ones. 

The NDIS review taking place right now gives us optimism, as it is a significant opportunity to improve many people's lives, including those with MS. 

MS Australia is calling for the NDIS to include six key priorities:

It's clear the Narrabeen Sports High community is fed up with the way the government has handled works on the school. 

As a mum of kids in public schools, I know how frustrating it is when it feels like a lack of funding is getting in the way of your child's education. 

I'm stepping up and making sure Narrabeen Sports High has its voice heard: if elected, I won't just look to refurbish the school, I'll work hard to get the funding needed to properly rebuild it. 

It's unacceptable that kids in our community are going to a school that doesn't have enough classrooms, lacks heating and cooling, has inadequate toilets and is rife with water damage. 

Over the past year I've chatted to many parents in the Narrabeen Sports High community and they all say the same thing: this rebuild is desperately needed, and the government hasn't listened to them. 

This election is an extraordinary opportunity to get the government to come to the table on important local issues like this one: the polls show we're likely heading towards a minority government, and independents may hold the balance of power. 

If I'm in a position where I'm negotiating with the major parties, I'll bring this to their attention and make obtaining funding for the rebuild an absolute priority - our childrens' education is too important.

Australia has made great progress in the past under the previous Liberal government when we became the first country in the world to ban the import of lion parts, rhino horn and elephant ivory. 

This was achieved by working closely with Donalea Patman from the Love of Wildlife who brought to my attention the abhorrent cruelty of the trophy hunting industry. 

This cruel industry saw canned hunting where lions were bred for the bullet, rhinos had their calves sliced whilst sleeping to make it easier to cut their horns off and elephants were poisoned with cyanide. 

Through her advocacy and my strong voice in Parliament we put a stop to these imports, we disrupted this abhorrent industry and stopped Australians from taking part. 

But at a state level much more can be done to stop domestic sales of parts and trophies. 

On a federal level Labor Labor needs to follow the lead of the former Liberal government and instead of just talking about wildlife actually do something to improve the life of our wildlife right now!

The Liberals have chosen to neglect the biggest infrastructure that runs our state, people.

Labor will address all these issues; we will reinvest into our healthcare with better payment of nurset, we'll bring back express trains and better maintain them, education will receive more teachers and a $400 million investment to properly pay for teachers, and our communities, we will properly fund these services that remain crucial for everyday life. Together, we can give Wahroonga & New South Wales a Fresh Start if you Vote 1 Parsia on the 25th!

No one under 30 is properly represented in our parliament. I want to change that and give our generation and future generations a voice as the outcomes made today will effect us later.

Van Badham and Ben Davison do their FINAL Week on Wednesday LIVE at Adelaide Fringe with special guest South Australian Aboriginal Affairs Minister and Attorney General Kyam Maher MLC discussing how South Australia became the first part of Australia to create a Voice to parliament and what lessons it provides for the national Voice referendum.

Van and Ben also look at how Peter Dutton has decided to frame the AUKUS deal, which was started when he was Defence Minister, as a choice between funding the NDIS or building submarines.  The false choice framework is explored as are the jobs that BOTH programs are providing to workers in Australia and the need to fully fund our society.  You can join your union, whether you're a care worker or a ship builder or any kind of worker, at australianunions.org.au/wow

The New South Wales election is less than two weeks away and Van and Ben break down Perrottet's half billion dollar voucher program and contrast it against Minn's $400m commitment to ""fully fund"" public schools and ""end the war on teachers"".

Plus there is good news about the death of ""Rambo"" and Billbies!

Van manages to give shout outs to our www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday Cadre and Extend the Reach supporters and all the Adelaide Fringe folk who have made these shows possible.

Invasive species have contributed to a whopping 75% of Australia‚Äôs extinctions, and they STILL imperil at LEAST another 123 threatened species. The CSIRO says that invasive species are Australia‚Äôs top threat, compared to overseas where invasive species are in the top 5 threats.

Dealing with invasive species must be a national priority if we want our bush to be the Australian bush, not one overtaken by weeds, diseases, European pests like rabbits or where predators like feral cats kill 2 BILLION native animals each year üò°

Ben Davison looks at (rants about?) how Insiders managed to spend three quarters of the show talking about submarines in the same week that the robodebt royal commission ended, the national reconstruction fund became law, the RBA put up interest rates for a record 10th consecutive time, the Aston by election is only three weeks away and the NSW election is only two weeks away!

Ben discusses how the unions in NSW that have been racking up wins across education, healthcare, transport as part of the campaign and the flow on effects for working people across the state.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

The Robodebt Royal Commission has wrapped up and despite Insiders discussing the cultural problems of the public service without mentioning that culture flows from the top, Morrison, Tudge, Porter, Stuart Robert, Ben discusses what the lack of billionaire owned media coverage says about the state of public discourse.

The RBA and Productivity Commission continue to kick working people.  Ben makes clear that Labor government's need to intervene to support working people.  That a former Liberal staffer running the Productivity Commission is unacceptable and that the RBA continues to use a broken ideology rather than economic reality to set monetary policy.

Ben reminds listeners that the FINAL Week on Wednesday LIVE at Adelaide Fringe is on THIS WEEK and the special guest will be Kyam Maher, Attorney General, Industrial Relations Minister and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who passed the first Voice to Parliament in Australia. tickets here: https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023

In this episode we chat to the 2022 Nurse Practitioner of the Year no less ‚Äì Peter Jenkin. 

Peter‚Äôs nursing career and commitment to palliative care starts well before last year‚Äôs award from the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners. 

For 11 years, and only up until recently he was a Palliative Care Nurse Practitioner for Resthaven aged care in South Australia. However, in early 2023, Peter moved to Canberra to take up a position with Calvary Health Care as a Palliative Care Nurse Practitioner working in aged care and at the ACT‚Äôs hospice, Clare Holland House.  

With aged care and health reform more broadly high on the Government's agenda, Peter has some clear advice on how Nurse Practitioners can be better utilised to deliver quality of life but is strident in his view that ‚Äúpalliative care should be everyone's business.‚Äù

The NSW Minister for Planning, Anthony Roberts MP has said that Council mergers have been a failure.  

Other candidates for the 2023 State election are also addressing the issue of failed Council mergers and how these mergers have been bad for their communities.  These candidates are promising to do something about it. 

In 2017, only 9 months after mergers were implemented, the Liberal Premier announced that the merger policy would be ABANDONED.  What a shame that the Premier did not also undo those 19 mergers at that time.

Many of these merged Councils have seen huge increases in Council rates.  Not only did communities get non-performing mergers that they didn‚Äôt want, they are now paying 30%-60% more in Council rates for it!

Loss of community voice, loss of representation, overwhelming bureaucracy and the enormous party-political control seen in many merged Councils has had major impact on communities and on Council performance.  

As we know in the Inner West, there is a major reason that the Labor Party is fighting against the demerger ‚Ä¶ it has delivered them full control over OUR Council.  The merger has been about what is best for the Labor Party NOT what is best for the Inner West community.  

At the poll, more people voted to demerge Inner West Council (104,219) than voted for their Councillors (104,035).   Look at the results any way you like, ALL of our 5 Council Wards in the Inner West voted to DEMERGE and ALL of our 21 suburbs in the Inner West voted to DEMERGE.  

Mergers have not and still do not deliver the promised efficiencies, savings, reduced costs and improved services.  State election candidates all over NSW have recognised this and demergers are now a key issue in this State Election.",Not a Voice Ad

Sarah founded WWYW in 2021, first staging a powerful exhibition of the outfits that survivors were wearing when they were assaulted. Since then, the organisation has gone from strength to strength, garnering the support of many community leaders and gaining a huge following.

Among many initiatives, Sarah has organised rallies attended by thousands of people, campaigned for anti-drink spiking measures, created support kits for sexual assault survivors, organised safe spaces at major events, and provides in-person support to people in the immediate aftermath of their assault.

As well as working to eliminate sexual assault and domestic violence, Sarah wants to help survivors use their voice and demonstrate that it is okay to speak out.

There wasn't just one nomination that came in for Sarah, there were several, which really demonstrates the impact she has had on our community.

Sarah is a trailblazer, and her drive and compassion are inspiring.

1354668391991375,106044005528545,Written By Chanee,['recognition'],,"This International Women‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôm thinking about strength.  

This is a hard post to write because, let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî sometimes being a women is a genuine challenge. It can be hard to get recognition for the gazillion things we juggle each day, and the millions of tiny acts of care we display for the people close to us. Self care can take a backseat when there are so many people around us relying on us to be the strong one in their lives.

It‚Äôs hard to be seen as strong when our strength so often lies under the surface. It can be hard for people to recognise our strength when so often it‚Äôs invisible. And women ARE strong. Yes, all of us. 

So this International Women‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôd like you to consider celebrating other women who just as empowered as you are. And I‚Äôd like you to consider stepping back for a second and recognising your own strength. Because it‚Äôs there, whether you pause long enough to recognise it or not. 

If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôd like you to remember your worth ‚Äî as a woman and as a contributing member of society. 

I‚Äôd encourage you to tell other women you know that you see them, and you see their strength shining through.

And I‚Äôd like you to consider how strong you personally are. How you‚Äôve made it through 100% of your toughest days on this planet and you‚Äôre still going. 

Celebrate your inner strength, and celebrate the strength of the women around you. 

We all deserve recognition, and if your recognition comes from within, it‚Äôs just as valid. 

Be the voice of reason you craved when you were younger. And be the voice for the next generation too, if you ever get the privilege. 

Hold onto your strength and draw upon it when you need it the most. 

Even if no one but you knows your personal journey, keep going. Travel through this life of ours, and remember: you are worth it. You‚Äôre worth the time. You‚Äôre worth the recognition. You‚Äôre worth the acceptance. And you‚Äôre worth celebrating your own story.

You are a woman. It‚Äôs time for you to shine ‚Äî today, and always. 

Happy International Women‚Äôs Day 2023 ‚Äî you‚Äôve got this!

Van Badham and Ben Davison LIVE from the Adelaide Fringe Yurt cover the broccolini boycott, Qantas refusing refuelling workers pay rises and the 10 big wins for women that unions have won in the last 12 months.

Van and Ben discuss the socialist foundations of International Women's Day, the struggles that are still to be won and Van's view of why being a woman shouldn't be an ""economic class"" but has been made one by men in grey suits.

Whatever industry you‚Äôre in you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

The outrageous ""bro"" behaviour of Elon Musk is brought into focus as he picks a fight with a hero of the Icelandic people.  Van and Ben explore how ego made a man who paid $44 Billion for Twitter ended up having to admit on Twitter that Twitter is not great for ""communication.  

As the Australian people wrestle with inflation, driven by profiteering, the RBA governor has admitted that the record increases in interest rates are being driven by ""the vibe"" of their ""business liaison"" rather than the stats of the ABS.  Van and Ben pull apart what the latest rate rise might mean and how it could impact working people.

And the good news is about a new deal for the world's oceans.

Van and Ben will be doing the FINAL edition of their AWARD winning Week on Wednesday LIVE from Adelaide Fringe next week with South Australian Attorney General Kyam Maher MLC to talk about The Voice in South Australia and the upcoming referendum.

I have the privilege to be the Liberal candidate for the Wagga Wagga Electorate for the upcoming state election. üåæ

As a Mother, Teacher, Small Business Woman, Councillor and Farmer I am motivated to run. To make real change in the electorate you need to have a seat at the table, you need to have a voice in Parliament! üó≥Ô∏è

My top three priorities are:

1. Fighting for improved infrastructure to keep up with the growing region. 

2. Better regional roads. 

3. To continue supporting young families. 

As part of Dominic Perrottet‚Äôs Liberal team, I‚Äôll fight for Wagga and deliver our long-term plan to keep NSW moving forward. üõ£Ô∏è

This plan includes growing the economy and creating jobs, delivering the infrastructure our region needs, increasing support to reduce pressure on household budgets and investment in nurses, teachers and doctors. 

Voting Liberal in this election means putting Wagga‚Äôs economy first, growing our region to support its expanding population and having a voice on the matters that impact you! üôåüèº",Not a Voice Ad

Our community members appear trapped in a sea of bureaucracy & non-disclosure agreements, I'm asking for your help to try & get them a fair shake.

These properties are poor, & it appears we have known about it for over a decade; some have been demolished & some still have people residing in them who feel trapped. If the engineer's report is correct, there are safety risks for them, their families & us.

I'm now asking you, the residents of our community, to join me in saying enough is enough; something needs to be done before someone gets hurt, and not afterwards. 

These residents & their children need somewhere safe to live; their neighbours need to know that they are safe & someone has to look into why this has even happened in the first place.

Please sign the petition in the comments; this isn't asking for anything more than for the Minister to address any urgent safety issues &, if there aren't any, to provide us the engineer's reports & risk assessments that rebut the others stating that there is, and the properties need demolishing with undue delay.

It only takes a minute to show you support your neighbours, so please, get behind our community & show that we're stronger when we stand together.

I refuse to back down as our current government erodes our social contract.

Last year, I got that all-too-common email saying my rent was hiked $100 per week. And I'll be honest, as a single woman and community youth worker, I don't have a lot of buffer room to cover that.

In the electorate of Summer Hill, 45% of us are renters. We've all heard the stories: people forced from their home with a no- grounds eviction, unsafe conditions the dodgy landlord won't fix, or just struggling to cover unending rent hikes. For too many of us, home ownership has become a distant dream. I‚Äôm calling for sustainable, affordable housing and infrastructure that will meet community needs, and is accountable to us.

I am greatly aware of how female dominated professions such as my own, as well as teaching and nursing, have been chronically undervalued and underfunded despite our work being vital. I‚Äôm fighting to bolster our teachers and local schools to deal with rising education inequality. I‚Äôm supporting nurses, carers, and health staff through ratios across all wards and caring sites; and I‚Äôm demanding a reinvigoration of TAFE with free courses. I see how these mounting issues, due to a lack of government resourcing, affect our young people, our elderly, our essential workers, and I say enough.

I‚Äôm running for The Greens because the people of Summer Hill deserve a representative who is pushing boundaries on what we can achieve. I‚Äôm a youth worker, a writer, a young person, and a proud Cypriot woman living on unceded Wangal land.

The Northern Land Council and its members have been involved in the fight for representative engagement with governments for many years ‚Äì including the Yirrkala Bark Petition in 1963 and the Barunga Statement in 1988. 

In 2015, the NLC, as a member of Aboriginal Peak Organisations of the Northern Territory (APONT) confirmed its support for constitutional recognition.

In 2017 the NLC hosted a regional dialogue in Darwin where more than 100 Aboriginal people from across the NT came together to discuss Constitutional reform and recognition. An elected Indigenous voice to Parliament was the number one preference.

In 2018 the NLC and the Central Land Council provided a submission to the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples that supported the establishment of a constitutionally-entrenched national body to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

At Kalkarindji in August 2022 the four NT Land Councils made a joint resolution in support of a referendum for a Voice in the current term of government.

The NLC is a member of the Referendum Engagement Group.

Invasive species have contributed to a whopping 75% of Australia‚Äôs extinctions, and they STILL imperil at LEAST another 123 threatened species. The CSIRO says that invasive species are Australia‚Äôs top threat, compared to overseas where invasive species are in the top 5 threats.

Dealing with invasive species must be a national priority if we want our bush to be the Australian bush, not one overtaken by weeds, diseases, European pests like rabbits or where predators like feral cats kill 2 BILLION native animals each year üò°

Macquarie Island is a clear reminder that we can spark a wildlife revival - but only if we choose native wildlife over invasives.

583880806947545,105539159106064,Thelma Ghayyem - Greens Candidate for Kellyville,,,"My name is Thelma Ghayyem, a proud Australian-Iranian citizen who is a nature lover, birdwatcher, rock climber and mountaineer, bush walker and environmental activist.

I'm standing to be the Greens candidate for Kellyville in the 2023 NSW election as l believe that we cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around us. 

As a mother of two, l‚Äôm greatly aware of how teaching has been undervalued despite the vital effect it has on society. I'm supporting teachers, early childhood educators, and l‚Äôm also demanding free TAFE courses for all, something which will ensure we are able to provide strong work opportunities for those who are disadvantaged in the workforce. I'm also aware of the importance of education and will give the people of Kellyville a strong voice on that.

It is very apparent how important it is to have access to green spaces, youth spaces, local swimming pools, to have well-maintained footpaths, bike lanes and more schools in the area. I will be pushing to invest more in all of these areas.

We are facing a cost-of-living crisis which is pushing our fellow community members out of area. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be pushing for the government to reduce the cost of public transport, healthcare and housing.

As a member of this community, my future concerns for children and youth is always around the corner in my mind and l believe we all need to take action on the climate emergency for a better future that we all deserve! We must phase out coal and gas, and retain existing bushland if we‚Äôre going to keep our environment intact.

I'm running for the Greens because people of Kellyville deserve a representative who understands the need of the neighbourhood. Last but not least ""never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."" The Earth is what we all have in common and the environment is where we all meet and where all have a mutual interest. It is the only thing all of us share!

I hope to have your support at the NSW election in March!

Ben Davison wraps up a huge week where the scale of corporate profiteering, what Sally McManus calls the Greed-Price Spiral, has been exposed as driving 69% of inflation, the nation is debating whether 11,000 people who have more than $5M in super should get a tax concession or whether that money is better invested in the 24,000,000 other people struggling under a 4.5% real wage cut, record rises in interest rates and underfunding in our public schools.

From the Heart #YES23 campaign launched in Adelaide and Australian Unions launched the Unions for YES campaign online (you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow) as the vast majority still support recognition and consultation being enshrined in the constitution.

At his 35th #MardiGras parade Albo became the 1st sitting PM to march at Mardi Gras as towards the back Tsarina Thorpe, self proclaimed ""Movement Leader"", staged a one woman protest and had to be removed.

Sadly Insiders became a turgid mess when Speers became fixated on ""Florence"" the bogged drill as Chris Bowen MP attempted to discuss emissions reduction policy, then for the second week in a row Speers obsessed over a minor detail in the Voice referendum working group that guest Mark Kenny called a ""phantom argument"" and finally Speers managed to round out the show by spending less than 10 seconds on the largest cut to real wages, record corporate profits and the greed-price spiral by throwing to the Murdoch journalist who made a quip about airline prices.

982785272693920,193163794039969,The School of Visibility,,,"Your work is too important to be silenced by visibility blocks. (Fears around being seen and heard.)

Visibility blocks look like worrying about being criticised for not knowing enough, having the 'wrong' body shape, being judged for being too successful, too different, and/or too much.

They stop you from: 
‚Üí building your business, 
‚Üí writing your book, 
‚Üí pursuing your dream speaking gig, or 
‚Üí advocating for your favourite cause.

Visibility blocks don't arise by chance. Systemic inequality plays a significant role in their creation. And systemic inequality is maintained by a dominant mindset that centres one perspective and one set of values. 

When your experience isn't centred by the system, it's easy to start questioning yourself. To doubt your own worth. 

'Smash the Patriarchal Mindset' is a 4 day course that looks specifically at the patriarchal mindset. It steps you through the impact it's having on your experience of visibility; using your voice and taking up space in the world. It'll help you to free yourself from the internalisation of those influences to you can confidently and consistently share your work with the world.",Not a Voice Ad

The Northern Land Council and its members have been involved in the fight for representative engagement with governments for many years ‚Äì including the Yirrkala Bark Petition in 1963 and the Barunga Statement in 1988. 

In 2015, the NLC, as a member of Aboriginal Peak Organisations of the Northern Territory (APONT) confirmed its support for constitutional recognition.

In 2017 the NLC hosted a regional dialogue in Darwin where more than 100 Aboriginal people from across the NT came together to discuss Constitutional reform and recognition. An elected Indigenous voice to Parliament was the number one preference.

In 2018 the NLC and the Central Land Council provided a submission to the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples that supported the establishment of a constitutionally-entrenched national body to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

At Kalkarindji in August 2022 the four NT Land Councils made a joint resolution in support of a referendum for a Voice in the current term of government.

The NLC is a member of the Referendum Engagement Group.

The Murdoch organisation has boycotted the Adelaide Fringe, Australia's largest arts festival, after a dispute about advertising.  Van and Ben look at what Australia's NINTH largest newspaper boycotting Australia's largest arts event has to do with Trump, Fox News, Sky News and the cultural war that has turned news audiences into market segments.

In the Yurt Van and Ben expose that ""broccolini"" is a trademarked term and that some of the agri-corp businesses, many around Adelaide, may not be all they seem.  The United Workers Union are encouraging people to contact Coles and Woolworths to demand that exploitation doesn't make it on Australian tables.  Don't forget you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

With The Statement from the Heart YES campaign launching and the Unions for YES campaign underway Van and Ben open the show with a traditional acknowledgement of country and discuss how Murdoch's NO campaign is as much about about subscription and advertising sales as it is trying to stop the referendum.

Albo spoke at the National Press Club about the concepts that underpin national security and Ben and Van explore how a broader understanding of security, security of employment, of pay, of opportunity and community participation comes together as the counter to the Murdoch organisation's project and Dutton's ""Noalition"".

Plus there is good news about renewable energy batteries.

Just recently, the MP visited Waubra to have lunch at Waubra's lovely Wayward Winery, before posting on Facebook, to say how great the view in Waubra is!

To add insult to injury Juliana Addison MP chimed in to say that she too would love to drop in for lunch.

The same view Labor's Martha Haylett MP has taken a photo of (below) will soon feature Labor's 190km of 85 meter tall transmission lines!

If that doesn't spoil the landscape in Waubra enough, Labor will also plonk a terminal station 12X the size of the MCG right in the middle.

Perhaps it's understandable why Martha and Juliana want to get in and enjoy the view now? Becasue in a few years time, Labor will have turned the beautiful farming town of Waubra into a devastating industrial wasteland, and call it a success for 'green' energy.

1254487642165925,106755941687833,Save Our Spuds,['labor'],,"Late last year Labor's Martha Haylett MP announced that Labor wants to move the AusNet terminal station (12X the size of the MCG), from Mt Prospect to Waubra - a tiny farming community just outside of Ballarat.

Just recently, the MP visited Waubra to have lunch at Waubra's lovely Wayward Winery, before posting on Facebook, to say how great the view in Waubra is!

To add insult to injury Juliana Addison MP chimed in to say that she too would love to drop in for lunch.

THIS HYPOCRISY IS CRAZY??!

The same view Labor's Martha Haylett MP has taken a photo of (below) will soon feature Labor's 190km of 85 meter tall transmission lines!

If that doesn't spoil the landscape in Waubra enough, Labor will also plonk a terminal station 12X the size of the MCG right in the middle.

Perhaps it's understandable why Martha and Juliana want to get in and enjoy the view now? Becasue in a few years time, Labor will have turned the beautiful farming town of Waubra into a devastating industrial wasteland, and call it a success for 'green' energy.

When the rest of the world is putting transmission lines underground, or investing in residential and business solar where it needs it most, OUR CITIES, the best Labor can do is dump their antiquated electricity infrastructure in small rural towns that don't have a voice.",Not a Voice Ad

Luckily, we don‚Äôt need the details to know that the Voice is a bad idea. Any reasonable, sensible person understands that dividing our great multicultural nation by race is not only a bad idea, it is the very description of racism.

From what I have gathered, we need more communal spaces! We need more areas in our public space which welcomes interaction and promotes a sense of community.
It is important to mention however that disability inclusion and diversity in the way we design our spaces is of priority. No matter what your ability may be, a community is not complete without your existence.

What are your thoughts?

950456922611899,116290644687688,Tina Kordrostami - Greens Candidate for Castle Hill,,,"Hi! My name is Tina Kordrostami and I am so excited to be your Greens candidate for Castle Hill in this year‚Äôs state election.

I migrated to Australia from Iran at the age of 5 and today I am an architectural designer passionate about spaces intended for the support of neuro divergent individuals. As a graduate of Masters in Architecture, I have developed principles and policies aimed towards the support of individuals living with mental health disabilities.

My activism for human rights has taken me as far as India to assist villages with housing needs and today I am passionate about the Iranian revolution as it is making way for a change which is long overdue.

As an immigrant, a designer, and an activist for human rights, I can recognise the demand for inclusion and diversity towards a growing and sustainable future.

I believe our community is formed by a rich array of races, beliefs, and experiences, all of which are required to be heard and understood. I believe that communication with the people who have shaped our setting is of utmost importance and will make the biggest difference in growth for a better tomorrow.

We are in the midst of a rising housing crisis and our environment is in a concerning ecological state as a result of investor greed, over development and our economy‚Äôs over-reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, the gender pay gap and lack of access to health and disability support is merely maintained and rarely spoken about.

Our community deserves equal and universal access to high quality public services with enough diversity to take into account everyone‚Äôs needs. If elected, I intend to broadcast this voice alongside those unheard as I would love to see our environment designed by those living in it. I am hopeful for our future because I recognise the kindness and capabilities that we have in our society.

If that doesn't spoil the landscape in Waubra enough, Labor will also plonk a terminal station 12X the size of the MCG right in the middle.

Perhaps it's understandable why Martha and Juliana want to get in and enjoy the view now? Becasue in a few years time, Labor will have turned the beautiful farming town of Waubra into a devastating industrial wasteland, and call it a success for 'green' energy.

When the rest of the world is putting transmission lines underground, or investing in residential and business solar where it needs it most, OUR CITIES, the best Labor can do is dump their antiquated electricity infrastructure in small rural towns that don't have a voice.",Not a Voice Ad

I‚Äôm proud to be advocating for equitable healthcare in our community.  I followed Eddie Wood chair of Manning Great Lakes Community Health Action Group.  We both agree that action is needed rather than election promises 6 weeks out from an election. The community needs certainty that our needs will be met no matter which government is elected. The community needs an answer from the NSW Nationals as to why our needs were not triaged higher than other locations, which based on the publicly available data, appear less urgent.  I‚Äôd also like to hear what NSW Labor will commit to Myall Lakes to ensure equitable healthcare.

Independents bring a different kind of politics, they are consultive, collaborative and work constructively across party lines to get things done. Independent MPs are only answerable to their community.  Independents can:
‚Ä¢ Genuinely represent the people of Myall Lakes 
‚Ä¢ Hold members of the government to account
‚Ä¢ Vote independently and speak freely on the issues

I will be a strong independent voice for equity in rural healthcare and will work with anyone who is truely committed to ensuring the healthcare needs of rural communities.  Allocation of resources needs to be free of politics no matter who is in government.

We've all heard the stories: people forced from their home with a no- grounds eviction, unsafe conditions the dodgy landlord won't fix, or just struggling to cover unending rent hikes. For too many of us, home ownership has become a distant dream. I‚Äôm calling for sustainable, affordable housing and infrastructure that will meet community needs, and is accountable to us.

I am greatly aware of how female dominated professions such as my own, as well as teaching and nursing, have been chronically undervalued and underfunded despite our work being vital. I‚Äôm fighting to bolster our teachers and local schools to deal with rising education inequality. I‚Äôm supporting nurses, carers, and health staff through ratios across all wards and caring sites; and I‚Äôm demanding a reinvigoration of TAFE with free courses. I see how these mounting issues, due to a lack of government resourcing, affect our young people, our elderly, our essential workers, and I say enough.

I‚Äôm running for The Greens because the people of Summer Hill deserve a representative who is pushing boundaries on what we can achieve. I‚Äôm a youth worker, a writer, a young person, and a proud Cypriot woman living on unceded Wangal land.

I am not your average politician. I am your community advocate.

Van Badham and Ben Davison examine former Greens Senator for Victoria Lidia Thorpe's announcement that she is no longer a Green Party member but is now leader of ""a grassroots Blak sovereign movement.""

They look at the commentary around her split from the Greens, events leading up to this moment, what ""a grassroots Blak sovereign movement"" might actually mean based on Thorpe's public statements and the implications for democracy and the Voice referendum.

Thorpe's announcement, made standing alone in a hallway, came on the first sitting day of parliament for 2023 where a large number of issues are being debated, including more improvements for workers rights.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow to make sure you get your proper wages and conditions.

Dark Brandon (a play on a meme about Joe Biden) rose today as Joe Biden nailed the Republican's during the State of the Union Address.  Van and Ben discuss how Qanon talking points, culture wars and performative politics have so consumed the Republicans that Biden was able to get them to publicly show support for social security and Medicare while their leaders accuse one another of horrendous crimes, ban books and want to legislate putting sugar in milk.

Plus there is good news from the SEA about both hydrogen and plastics!

Wildlife is too often forgotten when it comes to law reform. 

I have and will always be proud to be a strong voice for our wildlife in federal parliament.

Ben Davison reviews the return of the ABC's flagship political discussion show, Insiders.  As host David Speers manages to make incredibly dismissive off hand comment about the Robodebt Royal Commission and another panelist waves off the only first nations panellist's views about the situation in Alice Springs Professor Megan Davis patiently explains that The Voice referendum is about principles, not details. 

No one knows where the offices will be or what colour the business cards might have on them  but we do know that the launch of the YES campaign is happening while Ben and Van Badham will be doing the Week on Wednesday LIVE! at Adelaide Fringe Festival (tickets here: https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023) and our hosts hope to give you a report back in a future episode.

Ben looks at the Chifley Research Centre conference in Canberra where Albo has defined the referendum as being about two principles; Recognition and Consultation, Tony Burke has outlined the next phases of workplace law reforms and Jim Chalmers has built on his excellent Monthly essay where he essentially argues that society and the economy are two sides of the same coin.  Ben explores what that might mean in the context of the inflation challenge, falling living standards and record profits in some sectors.

Saturday was World Cancer day and Ben reminds us why union safety standards are so important; 1 in 10 cancers around the world are due to workplace exposure to hazardous material.

We are witness to the serious land use conflicts between farming communities of the Liverpool Plains and Gunnedah district. There is no doubt PEL‚Äôs 1 and 12 should be extinguished. There should be no coal seam gas mining on the Plains or the North-West - Full Stop.

In Nundle and Hanging Rock we also have a resource development proposal that Tamworth Regional Council has objected to and local majority objection has been demonstrated during two gruelling EIS public exhibitions.

Community division has eroded social capital established over decades of collaborative volunteering, and continues to impact community members‚Äô mental health and wellbeing.

Yet, the developer continues to force this proposal on the community because of the level of profit at stake. Not a good look for the Engie brand. Even metropolitan voters concerned about keeping the lights and air conditioning on want a ‚ÄúJust‚Äù and genuinely environmentally friendly transition to renewables.

Hills of Gold Wind Farm is outside of three neighbouring Renewable Energy Zones (Orana Central West, New England and Hunter), it threatens species protected by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and two neighbouring national parks.

The Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall MP is to be commended for speaking out on renewables resource developments proposed too close to people and in environmentally sensitive locations at Kentucky and Walcha.

The Member for Tamworth Kevin Anderson MP has stated for five years that the Hills of Gold Wind Farm is up to the community to decide. Yet in the face of repeated evidence of no social licence he won‚Äôt add his voice to lobby his own party on behalf of the people most impacted. The majority of immediate neighbours and the community of interest who do not support the proposal.

The new State Government has an opportunity to avoid the kind of community land use conflicts by truly listening to communities and taking notice of their own consultation. Be transparent with communities and put legislation in place to stop resource developments in inappropriate locations.

It‚Äôs spoiling our parks, playgrounds and rivers. Treasured wildlife is being stalked for food. Pressured ecosystems turned to sludge. Crops and livestock laid to waste üò•

A new report by the CSIRO has revealed the size of Australia‚Äôs invasive species problem. Globally, invasive species are ranked as having the 5th biggest impact on nature, but in Australia they are NUMBER ONE üíî

Nationally, invasive species have contributed to a whopping 75% of extinctions, and they STILL imperil at LEAST another 123 threatened species üêæ

Dealing with invasive species must be a national priority if we want to maintain our way of life and the identity of Australia. We want our bush to look like the Australian bush, not one invaded by a plethora of weeds and diseases.

Red fire ants are changing the way we live, work and play. Invasive ants have the potential to change the whole way Australia functions ‚Äî they are BBQ stoppers. 

Hungry predators like feral cats kill 2 BILLION native animals alone each year.

We can have a thriving Australian environment, but we must manage invasive species and stop the damage. It's a daunting task. We all have a role to play. We have to start somewhere. Yours starts here ‚úèÔ∏èüíî

Ben Davison takes a closer look at the situation in Alice Springs and how the end of a 15 year ban on alcohol in some communities coincided with cuts to support services, a federal election and a Morrison government unable to think beyond the news cycle combined to create the slow moving storm that has now engulfed the community.  
And maybe provides the clearest example of why The Voice is needed.

Ben looks at how the West Australian opposition, with only six lower house members across two parties, has managed to find itself in disarray at the start of 2023.

With more companies abandoning ships Ben takes a look at the case of the Yangtze Fortune and the crew.  Owed money, unable to get home to the Philippines and no clear path to freedom the workers are relying on the ITF Asia Pacific - International Transport Workers' Federation and the Maritime Union to make it through each day.

After enduring a horrific apartment experience last year and moving to a different state, I thought we had put it to bed and moved on with our lives. But, The Universe has other plans for I, it works through us. (It was NOT over btw.)

See I thought I was going to be a singer when I grew up, my voice is my soul. It‚Äôs the passion that lights the fire under my insides. Yet I had constant external forces saying, ‚Äúwhen are you going to learn to shut your mouth.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis world doesn‚Äôt like a mouthy young lady.‚Äù Well, when you allow your four year old daughter to watch Rush Limbaugh at her leisure, she is going to find her own values in the world pretty quickly. And I did.

Knowing what I know now, everything I experienced over the years was in an effort to wake me up. Learning how to heal my own body because the US government‚Äôs foundation of learning for doctors in this country leaves out a key method to healing, for example. This was just one point of awareness over the course of a lifetime. Or maybe how an old friend of mine used to work at Wells Fargo and I was a victim of their account scheme back in the day when she worked there. This wasn‚Äôt aware to me until I saw Dirty Money, we are no longer friends. The list is endless. 

So here I find myself in Kansas City, MO. A notoriously deep Red state with some deep problems that have lead me to become a full-blown activist. Grant and I have had to become actual crime fighters, just two weeks ago chasing down a thief that made off with some woman‚Äôs bag in broad daylight. After having been mugged and assaulted in New York, this was a win that we got her bag back! Scooter Gang to the Rescue!! 

On a serious note, my first step in the state healthcare issue is getting the federal government involved because Missouri is breaking federal laws. The wealthy population thrives here while the financial divide grows so wide, it can only be compared to that of a science fiction film. I thought I was going to be a singer, a fashionista, a model, an actress. But deep down I always knew I was just looking for the means to find a platform to make a difference in the world.

For this day to be significant, we must look beyond the surface-level pride in our nation and acknowledge the deep-rooted trauma endured by many Indigenous Australians due to colonisation and dispossession. 

While we acknowledge our day of national pride, consider the country's heritage dates back millions of years, and our first people's voice quietened two hundred ago. A change of date may not give back the years. Nonetheless, it may allow Indigenous voices to join the national pride. 

Compassion can bridge divides, unite us in understanding and create pathways for healing.

Ben goes through why working people have had enough of the cuts, the costs and the waste during  a decade of mismanagement by the Liberals.  Also how unions are getting organised to win better pay, services and more secure jobs, join them at australianunions.org.au/wow 

You can check out Van and Ben's interview with Labor leader Chris Minns from December 7th on Episode 114 of The Week on Wednesday.

The Voice enjoys support from a majority of Australian's in a majority of states.  While Dutton ""reaches for the Abbott playbook"" and the conservative media try to pretend otherwise every state, except Queensland, would deliver a comfortable majority YES to for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice referendum.  Ben breaks it down state by state.

Ben touches on the retirement of Jacinda Ardern. Van's Guardian article articulates why she was important, not just to New Zealand but to many people around the world.

Ben closes off with an examination of the escalating problems at Qantas.  Remember you can hear what the maintenance workers were telling Ben and Van back in September in Episode 104 about Joyce's cuts.  SIX MONTHS BEFORE the four ""mechanical issues"" in three days that the airline has suffered this week.

Van Badham and Ben Davison look at how Dutton is playing politics over The Voice to parliament, why he's playing a politically dangerous game and just how easy it is to find ""the detail"" he claims he cannot find.  (Ben reads it out if you're interested Peter)

Turns out gas appliances aren't great for our health, our environment or our wallets but, as culture war correspondent Van Badham reports, there's enough vested interests to keep American law makers and ridiculous sky news types ranting about why pumping gas that makes unwell directly into your home should be a right.

With workplace law changes meaning more workers than ever will be able to get the benefits of union negotiated and won pay agreements the debate about ""free riders"" has started.  Many union leaders from sectors as diverse as childcare and the rail industry, healthcare and manufacturing are calling for changes to the law to allow for union won pay rises to include a fee for the service that non-members would have to pay.  Van and Ben discuss the idea, where it has come from and how Australia has ended up with huge numbers of people getting benefits they aren't paying for at the moment.  

You can join your union anytime at australianunions.org.au/wow to make sure your workplace has the resources needed to win better pay and conditions.

I‚Äôm running because the community needs a strong, lifelong advocate for action to bring climate change under control and  push for public education and healthcare to have the attention that they need. 

Until my retirement in 2014, I was a public-school teacher. I spent 30 of my 35 years of service at Quakers Hill Public School. While in the workforce, I was a committed unionist with the NSW Teachers Federation, culminating in 4 years as President of Blacktown Teachers Association.

To volunteer, please head to my webpage at https://greens.org.au/nsw/person/rob-vail . Together we can:

(1) Reduce the impact of climate change by encouraging light-coloured roofs with solar panels and preventing overdevelopment, especially housing development on flood-prone land in Schofields & Riverstone.

(2) Make public education a major priority from early childhood through primary & secondary school to TAFE & university, with modern classrooms replacing demountables, the public-sector wage cap gone, and teachers better treated.

(3) Address the problems in our public healthcare system, with better working conditions for nurses, better healing conditions for patients, and better pay for hospital and ambulance service staff.

(4) Provide NSW residents with safe, toll-free roads and more affordable and social housing;

(5) Deliver a treaty and a voice for First Australians.

I‚Äôll represent our community‚Äôs values in the NSW Parliament and try to keep the major parties honest. Together, we can act on climate change & build a better future for our children.

They‚Äôre ignoring the real emotional issues and pushing kids to ‚Äòescape‚Äô their bodies by pursuing irreversible puberty blockers and ultimately radical surgery.

A senior doctor at the Royal Children‚Äôs Hospital even wants your taxpayer dollars to perform double mastectomies on girls so they can look like boys.

But many young people who ‚Äòtransition‚Äô later regret such life-altering treatments ‚Äì and can feel suicidal.

And there are new concerns that puberty blockers can affect a child‚Äôs brain development.

London‚Äôs infamous Tavistock gender clinic was shut down after former patient and detransitioner Keira Bell argued she was incapable of giving informed consent to puberty blockers she began at age 16 after a deeply troubled childhood. 

So why are Australia‚Äôs radical gender clinics still open and abusing kids like this?

Did you know that it‚Äôs illegal in Victoria, Queensland and ACT for doctors and counsellors to do anything but 'affirm‚Äô a child‚Äôs gender confusion?

In Victoria even parents are criminalised if they do anything but 'affirm' their child‚Äôs gender confusion.

There are currently 25 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander MPs elected to the State and Federal Parliaments across Australia.  That‚Äôs 3.0% of ALL 832 State and Federal MPs.  ATSI peoples make up 3.8% of the Australian population.  

If we look at the LOWER HOUSES of Parliament, ATSI representation is LOW at the Federal level.  Only 3 of the 151 lower house seats in Federal Parliament are held by ATSI MPs or 2.0%.  It‚Äôs only marginally better in the lower hoses of State Parliament with 12 of the 455 seats (2.6%) being held by ATSI MPs ‚Ä¶ almost half of these are in NT alone!  If you remove NT, only 7 of 430 State seats are held by ATSI MPs (1.6%).  It might appear that work needs to be done at both the Federal and State level to address ATSI representation in the Lower Houses of our Parliaments.

Looking at the UPPER HOUSES of Parliament, we see a solid representation of ATSI Senators at the Federal level ‚Ä¶ being 8 of the 76 senators (10.5%).  But ‚Ä¶ at the State level, only 2 of the 155 Legislative Council positions are held by ATSI MPs or 1.3%. 

Lets not forget the 128 NSW Councils ‚Ä¶ 107 NSW Councils have no ATSI Councillors.  Based on 2021 data, there were 25 ATSI Councillors or 1.9% of the 1,293 Councillors in NSW.  

There were only 2 ATSI Councillors of the 412 Councillors across Greater Sydney.  In fact, 32 of the 34 Councils in greater Sydney do not have an ATSI Councillor.  Inner-city Councils such as Sydney, Inner West, Burwood, Strathfield and Canada Bay all reported no ATSI Councillors.

In 2021, a total of 23 or 92% of ATSI Councillors in NSW were outside Sydney; in rural areas or regional centres.  

There appears to be some work that needs to be done in the area of local representation for ATSI peoples on NSW Councils.

Ben looks at how the dysfunctional Republican Party took a record number of ballots to finally elect the only candidate they had for speaker and why the next two years may be ungovernable for the Party that once saw itself as the ""natural party of government"".

Peter Dutton has kicked on 2023 behind in the polls and desperate to find a pathway into government.  
Today's press conference on The Voice was a classic polyphonic speech, talking to multiple audiences with a different set of meanings.  It was crass, it was disingenuous, it displayed how he remains beholden to far right ideologues and it had a touch of cooker sprinkled into the middle.

Ben breaks down why this double speak will fail to win back the Menzian centre right and further entrenches people's distrust of Dutton and his conservative rump.

Prepare for a year of gaslighting, in which you will be told that the only way to ""Close the Gap"" is:

1) Vote YES, as directed by the gov't, unions, media, big business, and the grievance industry, pushed with $75M of your money.

2) They will then decide what YES means

3) Aboriginal Australians and Bruce Pascoe will have a free and fair race-based election

4) The results of the free election will be equal male and female, etc etc - ""The Voice"".

5) ""The Voice"" will come up with ""The Advice""

6) ""The Advice"" will be sent to the gov't

7) They will then ""Close the Gap""

It is hard to imagine a more expensive waste of time! 

We already have an Aboriginal ""Minister for Indigenous Australians"", with 10 other Aboriginal Australians in Parliament (elected in the normal, non-racist way).

They are already able to seek and receive ""advice"" from every Aboriginal person, organization and community in the nation. Why would 24 elected activists know any better, about what ""advice"" to give?

Abortion threatens their human rights. 

‚Ä¶ Especially now as Australia has some of the most brutal abortion laws in the world.

Abortion on demand is now legal in most states ‚Äì even up to a child‚Äôs moment of birth. 

But every abortion ends an innocent life.

Instead of killing babies, Australians should be building a culture that values human lives ‚Äì especially the unborn.

It‚Äôs possible to change Australia‚Äôs abortion laws.  

But it will take time to change minds and get more people on board. 

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs vital to start now ‚Äì by building a movement of people like you who‚Äôll put their hands up to champion and value unborn babies.

You can help speak up for babies by signing this open letter now demanding that politicians stand up for the human rights of unborn children.

By signing this open letter, you‚Äôll help back more pro-life, pro-family policies to give vulnerable mothers a choice ‚Äì and their babies a voice.

Since the election, the Albanese Labor Government has been working hard to deliver that future. 

Already we have:

Made child care cheaper for 1.2 million Australian families, making it easier to parents to return to work and save money. 

We have built a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. The Commission will investigate corrupt conduct across the entire federal public sector and it will restore trust and integrity to federal politics. 

On climate change, we have legislated a net zero target by 2050, and forty three per cent by 2030 and we started work on securing our renewable energy future. 

That includes cheaper electric vehicles, rewiring the nation to support renewables  and the installation of 400 community batteries across Australia ‚Äì  including in Bayswater and Dianella. 

And we are rebuilding our international relationships, so Australia is treated seriously on the world stage.

We hosted the Jobs and Skills summit, and as a result, worked to correct ten years of stagnant wage growth and made gender equity an object of the Fair Work Act.

We have abolished the Cashless Debit Card.

We started the Royal Commission into Robodebt.

We made 24/7 registered nurses at aged care facilities the law. 

We expanded paid parental leave to six months. 

We have delivered 465,000 fee-free TAFE places to fix our skills crisis.

And provided an extra 20,000 university places. 

And we have started the work to repair the budget and the Liberals' trillion dollar debt.
