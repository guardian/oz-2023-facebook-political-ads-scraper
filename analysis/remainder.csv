Van Badham and Ben Davison explore the broken philosophy of The RBA that denies profiteering is a problem until everyone else has said it is, continues to believe in a wage-price spiral that doesn't exist and both simultaneously says people should get more work but we need less people employed.  

Of course the union movement was among the first to point out the fallacies of the RBA's ideology and continues to win better pay and conditions so join at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben and Van also examine how Japan's monetary policy is structured and the outcomes that can be achieved when the high priests of Milton Friedman are no longer in charge.

The Greens have delayed the Housing Affordability Future Fund until at least October.  

Ben and Van look at the arguments, break down the math and try to get a better understanding whether it is politicking or ignorance that is driving The Greens to upend millions of dollars in social housing funding.

The referendum legislation has passed parliament meaning that the government must call a referendum within six months.  Van and Ben discuss the campaign so far, the work being done for a big national YES day on July 2nd and offer solidarity to those being attacked by the billionaire and corporate owned media for daring to have a Voice.

The good news is that despite the misinformation and vast corporate media NO machine the YES vote is ahead.  Ben and Van look at some polling, some analysis and give their views.

Ben Davison looks at the first 12 months of the Albanese Labor government and some of the big changes ranging from the National Anti-Corruption Commission and Robo-debt royal commission to improvements in job security and wages to NDIS reforms and genuine action on climate change.  The first year of Labor at a national level has achieved a lot.

The union movement has had successes on wages, women's participation in the workforce, job security, the energy transition authority and improvements to the social wage.  join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben also takes a look at why media is obsessed with the negatives.  The Voice is a classic example where two polls released in the same week get very different treatment by the media.  Ben explains how this empowers the fringe elements and the impact that has on people, such as Stan Grant's announcement, and our political system.

The Liberal's in Victoria continue to want a party leader that will embrace hatred and defend Nazism with the state conference in Bendigo marred by walkouts, booing and cries of ""shame"" as Menzian Liberal leader John Pesutto took the stage.

Ben asks the question, if we want more progress on #education, #healthcare, #NDIS, tax reform and #climate change do we really think the Liberals will deliver it better than Labor?

They dissect David Speers' on defence policy, consider #insiders decision to ignore reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), ask whether Albo attending the Sandilands wedding was either good or bad politics and the dangers of mistaking online abuse for a real-world movement.

Our hosts discuss what real reforms to the social safety net would look like, and how media needs to be careful not to fall into the traps that right-wing media are now tangled in when reporting on policy reforms to the NDIS, unemployment and housing.

They also cover Australian Unions using May Day to campaign for The Voice, with Sally McManus and Michele O'Neil on the ground in the ""soft"" states of Queensland and South Australia. This comes on the back of polling showing that YES would win the referendum if it were held today.... so, join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Van Badham and Ben Davison return home from their award winning run at the Adelaide Fringe Festival to discuss the NSW State Election, on March 25th, the issues, the leaders, the optional preferential system and the seats to watch.  It is looking like a tight election but if NSW wants, as the polls are suggesting they do, guaranteed minimum staffing levels in hospitals, public schools that have resources for every student, wages that are going up and leadership that's focused on the issues that matter to everyday people then Labor should win. 

Of course Unions NSW and the many affiliate unions that are made up of workers in sectors cut, smashed and abandoned by Perrottet's Liberals are campaigning and you can become a union member to protect your rights at work, whatever state you are in, at australianunions.org.au/wow 

In Victoria we suffered through a TERF-Nazi joint rally on the weekend.  Van explains how TERFs are NOT feminists, are a vocal EXTREMIST minority and that Liberal MPs and Senators defending those associated with these individuals are putting a toxic set of values into our political discourse.  Van and Ben offer their solidarity to members of the Trans community and all minority groups who would have, understandably, been concerned by the scenes over the weekend.

The Voice is a step closer with the machinery of the referendum set to pass the parliament.  The laws on how to run the referendum needed updating given we haven't had a referendum since the invention of social media!

And there is good environmental news about the capturing of carbon which may or may not being able to supply every home with enough baking soda to ensure no fridge is ever smelly again!

Van also acknowledges our Cadre and Extend the Reach Supporters who have gone to www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday and helped us grow our audience.

Van Badham and Ben Davison return home from their award winning run at the Adelaide Fringe Festival to discuss the NSW State Election, on March 25th, the issues, the leaders, the optional preferential system and the seats to watch.  It is looking like a tight election but if NSW wants, as the polls are suggesting they do, guaranteed minimum staffing levels in hospitals, public schools that have resources for every student, wages that are going up and leadership that's focused on the issues that matter to everyday people then Labor should win. 

Of course Unions NSW and the many affiliate unions that are made up of workers in sectors cut, smashed and abandoned by Perrottet's Liberals are campaigning and you can become a union member to protect your rights at work, whatever state you are in, at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben looks at the first two weeks of the parliamentary sitting for 2023 where Labor introduced housing policy, manufacturing policy and emissions reduction policy all of which were opposed by Dutton and the Greens.  Plus our friend Mary Doyle is running for Aston following Tudge's retirement.

The bosses pamphlets have argued against working people being involved in the running of the country but you can have your say by joining your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Adam Bandt went on Insiders and couldn't name one country that has banned new coal and gas, couldn't say how much it would cost and wouldn't support his own Senator's statement that the government should arbitrarily override the RBA.  Ben discusses why the RBA is wrong and how the government can systemically address the issues without random interventions.

While the nation is gearing up for the launch of YES to The Voice campaigns (union online launch this Wednesday night https://www.australianunions.org.au/action/voice-campaign-launch  and Statement from the Heart campaign launch on Thursday https://fromtheheart.com.au/take-action) Samantha Maiden repeated Dutton talking points about the Voice not ""fixing things"" on Insiders.  

Ben looks at how empowerment has improved outcomes in the NDIS and why The Voice will help close the gap.

And finally Ben takes a look at the chaos that is the NSW Liberal state government.  From Minister's distributing explicit pictures to undisclosed conflicts of interest in toll roads to MPs banned from entering parliament while facing criminal charges running as an ""independant"" the Liberal-National Coalition looks on the ropes.  

UnionsNSW is running a campaign ""Essential Workers Deserve Better"" focused on the high costs, low wages, high workload approach of the Liberals that Labor has promised to change.

Van and Ben will be doing the Week on Wednesday LIVE! from Adelaide Fringe https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023 for the next four weeks.
