That could mean reparations, a “black parliament”, and oversight of executive government and the public service. 

Meanwhile there’s a crime crisis in Alice Springs, along with an energy and cost of living crisis that’s just going to get worse.

This referendum divides Australians by race, gives one small group of Australians an extra say over Parliament and the Government, and will cost the earth.

And to top it off, the dangerous and divisive Voice is a “first step” towards Treaty and “agreement making”.

That could mean reparations, a “black parliament”, and oversight of executive government and the public service. 

Meanwhile there’s a crime crisis in Alice Springs, along with an energy and cost of living crisis that’s just going to get worse.

It’s not right and it’s not fair.

But you can help fight back now by signing this pledge, telling Anthony Albanese you’ll vote ‘NO!’.

This referendum divides Australians by race, gives one small group of Australians an extra say over Parliament and the Government, and will cost the earth.

And to top it off, the dangerous and divisive Voice is a “first step” towards Treaty and “agreement making”.

That could mean reparations, a “black parliament”, and oversight of executive government and the public service. 

Meanwhile there’s a crime crisis in Alice Springs, along with an energy and cost of living crisis that’s just going to get worse.

It’s not right and it’s not fair.

But you can help fight back by signing this open letter to Anthony Albanese now.

We are ONE together, not two divided. I never thought this would happen in Australia.

In the country that proudly sings “We are one and free”.

The country that taught me that we are united no matter where we come from.

And it would permanently give one small group of Australians an extra say over Parliament and the Government.
