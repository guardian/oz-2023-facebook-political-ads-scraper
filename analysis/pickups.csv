For this day to be significant, we must look beyond the surface-level pride in our nation and acknowledge the deep-rooted trauma endured by many Indigenous Australians due to colonisation and dispossession. 

While we acknowledge our day of national pride, consider the country's heritage dates back millions of years, and our first people's voice quietened two hundred ago. A change of date may not give back the years. Nonetheless, it may allow Indigenous voices to join the national pride. 

Compassion can bridge divides, unite us in understanding and create pathways for healing. This Australia Day, let’s recognise the pain of our country’s past and commit ourselves to create a future where everyone can share in the joy of celebrating together with pride.  Let’s make sure that this day is remembered not only for its celebration but also for the compassion we show towards each other as Australians.  Let’s honour all cultures by creating an inclusive culture built on empathy, kindness and respect. That is genuine national pride and unity! Happy Australia Day! 🦋
