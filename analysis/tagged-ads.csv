Ben Davison is BACK after a two week break with a deep dive on the FIVE big issues that should be dominating the national debate.

1. 98% of our public schools don't have the resources they need.  Ben reads out a message from a listener about how the failure to support every child has left class sizes too big, teachers overworked and kids missing out on the support they need.

2. #Inflation is coming down.  The spokesperson from the bosses pamphlet on Insiders continued to recite the neo-liberal mantras of higher rates, more unemployment and lower wages but Ben outlines how Jim Chalmers and Labor are implementing a neo-Keynesian approach that is bringing down prices, keeping people in work and supporting those most in need.

3.  Workplace reforms are coming to parliament to stop the multi-billion dollar loopholes that see labour hire workers paid less, forced casualisation of millions of people and profiteering at working people's expense.  There's a union for every worker, casual, labour hire, teacher, miner, nurse, graphic designer and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow

4. The Housing Affordability Future Fund is coming back.  With $1,300,000 a day NOT going into housing because of the Greens back Dutton's Noalition Labor is ready to set up a double dissolution trigger.

5. The Voice.  Greg Sheridan can go on #Insiders to say that Dutton isn't racists if the referendum fails but if all the racists are voting NO does it matter if he considers himself to be racist?  Ben argues you pick a side.  No has Pauline Hanson and Andrew Bolt.  Yes has Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson.

Which side are you on?

Plus Ben touches on why the noise around the Rockingham by-election is meaningless Liberal narrative and why Dutton's abysmal record on government contracts is best left to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to determine.

Hundreds have already added their voice to the growing opposition to Macquarie University's censorship of the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) club because of our anti-war, socialist perspective. The IYSSE is the only youth and student movement internationally which is seeking to end the US-NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine and the US-led war drive against China which threaten a catastrophic nuclear third world war. University management is seeking to prevent students and young people from encountering such a perspective amid the global capitalist crisis which is driving many youth to left-wing and revolutionary politics.

The man frowned and stood up as he handed him her picture. ""Where? And how?"" He asked, taking her picture. 
""They found her shopping. But, boss...your ex-wife had triplets in her arms..."" 
--------------------------------------------------
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Iris asked, shaking her head in question at her husband as she tried to understand why he was angry with her this time. 
Her husband was packing his things, wanting to leave the house without giving her a proper explanation of what was going on. The two of them did not even argue; therefore, she did not understand what his issue was this time.
‚ÄúDean, please don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù She begged, trying to take his hand. Her husband was quick to pull his hand away, glaring at her.
‚ÄúI never did love you, and I never will. You and I both know that our marriage was over long before it even started.‚Äù He said, reminding her that their marriage was an arranged one. She had hoped that he would love her by time, she prayed, she fought, she stood strong, tried to lure him in toward her, but nothing worked. The man was as cold as ice when it came to her, and that was something that she failed to realize.
She put her hand on her stomach as she felt it bloat. The last thing she wanted was to lose another pregnancy. This time, Dean didn‚Äôt even know about it, she didn‚Äôt want to give him any hope like she used to only to end up losing him again if she lost another one of his children.
She knew that Dean wouldn‚Äôt touch her if sober and has only slept with her because he was drunk.
She could still remember the night very well. Her husband, the man that she was deeply in love with, had moaned out his mistress‚Äôs name in her ear as he imagined her before coming undone. She could still remember the pain and humiliation that she felt, but she never spoke about it to him. 
The next morning, when both woke up, the man didn‚Äôt bother looking at her. He didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the fact that she was in bed.
‚ÄúDean, the two of us have tried. I have tried, for years, I have tried to satisfy you. But‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúThen stop.‚Äù He said, stopping her. She looked down at her feet, avoiding his eyes as tears formed in her eyes. She gripped her shirt as she felt weak. The fact that she knew what had to be done was something that she hated. The man has been insisting on them filing a divorce for months now, and he has been wanting it to end in one sitting. The one way to do so was for both of them to agree on this divorce, making it a ‚Äòmutual‚Äô one, and though it killed her inside, she knew that it had to be done. There was no use to fighting for a relationship that was done.
The man didn‚Äôt even want her, and that was something that she knew.
She looked up at the man before wiping her tears, her mind set on the one target that she had in mind. She wanted to keep her child, and she was determined on building her own family. The man may have broken her, he has done it more times than any man has ever done before, and the last thing she wanted was to deal with more of this pain.
Thankfully, she knew that she had the support of her father, but that didn‚Äôt mean that things were going to be easy. If anything, they were not. Her mother was not going to like the fact that she had agreed to a divorce. The woman believed that every marriage had its conflicts, and that everything had a solution.
But Iris knew it for fact, this marriage was over, and whether or not her mother liked it; she was not going to proceed with it. If she was to raise her child in a sane environment, then she had to ensure that she created it for the baby first, and therefore, choosing to leave was going to be the best option.
She was to raise her baby as far away as she could from all these dark memories, and one day, if her child chose to want to see their father, she would be more than welcoming to allow the idea. The man didn‚Äôt even care that he had broken her heart as he turned to his things, fixing them in his suitcase. She knew that he was going to that woman, his mistress, the woman who has somehow managed to earn his heart. Ariana.
‚ÄúYou wanted to file for a divorce?‚Äù She asked, making Dean frown in confusion. He stopped packing his things, and turned to face her, clearly surprised with what she was asking.
His chest ached for a second, and he felt like his breath got caught in his throat. The man nodded, crossing his arms over his chest as he waited to hear what she had to say. She put her hand on her chest, ignoring the pain that she was feeling in the pit of her stomach and her chest. She had to stand strong to fend for her baby. A heartbreak was not going to do her any good, and the constant arguing was only going to end up breaking her.
‚ÄúI remember that you had copies of the papers before? You wanted me to sign them.‚Äù She said, keeping her eyes on his, ignoring all the pain that she felt at that very moment as her heart begged her not to do this. She knew that she had to, for her baby, heart, and sanity, she had to do this. Dean studied her expression, unsure of what to say before he nodded.
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He said, regretting it almost instantly. He knew that she was well aware that he had them. There was no use lying about it now.
‚ÄúI will sign them and get out of your life, Dean Andino.‚Äù  She said, looking him dead in the eye, ‚Äúso, please, do give them to me. Let us end this marriage mutually‚Ä¶‚Äù
......5 years later......
Iris:
‚ÄúLilian, that is enough.‚Äù I said, scolding my daughter who was trying to be stubborn. A habit that she seems to have developed since we came here.
She has been refusing to allow me to put on her shirt for the past half an hour and has been trying to escape me since. I hated admitting it, but she was as stubborn as her father was.
‚ÄúBut, mama, I don‚Äôt like this shirt.‚Äù She said, pouting her lips. 
I sighed and put the shirt down before taking her hands in mine, pulling her to my chest. It was something that I always did when she was having a fit. Trying to understand her often helped, though sometimes I even failed to do that. I still tried my best.
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt like this shirt, nor did you like the other twenty shirts that I pulled out.‚Äù I said, teasing her. She giggled and shook her head at me before putting her hand in her mouth. 
I was thankful for her being in my life, she was a blessing to me that made all the struggles that I have been through with my ex worthwhile. At least I knew that my little princess wasn‚Äôt in a toxic place where the two of us were constantly fighting, and I knew that she was somewhat happy in the life that she was living. 
‚ÄúIs there anything that is bothering you, my little princess?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to school.‚Äù She said, and I smiled. It was her first day at preschool, and she has been giving me a hard time since last night. 
At least now I understand why. The fact that she didn‚Äôt want to go anywhere where kids were with both their parents was something that I was somewhat used to, and though it did sometimes hurt me to know that I didn‚Äôt do enough to fulfill my role as the mother and father figures in her life, I couldn‚Äôt blame her. 
‚ÄúCan you tell me why you don‚Äôt want to go to school? Are you afraid of not fitting in?‚Äù I asked, trying to be as gentle as I could be with her. 
But she had the same attitude on her third day at her daycare, and when I asked what happened, it was her teacher who explained to me that she felt different when she realized that most of the kids had both their parents with them, and that she only came with me. It killed me inside that I had to separate her from her father, but I knew since that day that things wouldn‚Äôt have been the same.
‚ÄúWhy do other kids have a daddy and I don‚Äôt?‚Äù She asked, making my chest ache. 
How could I explain to a four year old that her father never bothered giving me a chance to begin with? I tried to shower her with the love that any daughter could get, but I wasn‚Äôt her father, and I knew that no matter how hard I would try to be, I was never going to be. 
‚ÄúYou do have a daddy, sweetheart, and one day, very close, I will be sure that the two of you reunite again. For now, I just need you to be a little patient.‚Äù I said, my voice softening as I ran my hand over her cheek.
As much as I hated what happened between us, I never did try to make her hate her father. In her eyes, he was the hero that she wanted to meet. I just didn‚Äôt know how that was going to be possible right now.
The two of us have been living in Orlando since she was born, and my parents would visit every once and a while, but now, considering that it has been almost five years since I left; therefore, I believed that it was time to go back. I had my businesses to tend to, and with my father growing ill by the day, I knew that I had to start taking care of them. It was one of the reasons why I was going back to begin with. The one issue that I had was knowing that Dean was a main partner. Just the idea of having to see him in a meeting or gathering was something that I feared, but I knew that it was about time to face him. I couldn‚Äôt keep running away from him for life, right?
Lilian kept her eyes on mine, studying my expression for a few seconds before she nodded. She often knew when she was giving me a hard time and when she wasn‚Äôt, and she knew that she was. She looked at her shirts for a few seconds before pulling the pink one that I wanted to put on her. Thankfully, she had a white bateau on, otherwise, I would have worried about her growing sick. Especially considering the fact that it was November.
‚ÄúDo you want to choose your coat? Or are you going to be giving mommy a hard time again?‚Äù I asked, teasing my daughter who giggled, clearly amused by what she did. 
She knew that she mostly didn‚Äôt get in trouble. In truth, I rarely ever thought of punishing her. In my head, she was my little princess, and I was there to spoil her. The last thing that I wanted was for her to be scared of me or to want to be away from me.
If anything, I had taught her at a young age to come and tell me everything. I would be there by her side, backing her up, even if I had to scold her sometimes if I knew that she did something bad. But the last thing I wanted was for her and I to have the same relationship that I had with my mother.
It was one that was almost nonexistent, and I knew that it was one of the reasons why Dean and I never worked out.
The man didn‚Äôt respect me as he saw that my family didn‚Äôt. The man saw me as weak and unwanted, and though our marriage was initially arranged, the two of us could have managed to work a few things out, I believed it. But things somehow backfired on me when he heard a conversation between my mother and I, and somewhere deep inside me, I knew that we would never be able to be one.
The gap had been created that night, and it was all because of that argument. It was an argument that sent him off to finding his peace elsewhere, and that is something that I can never forget. It is something that I personally would have never wanted; however, he chose not to listen, and she chose to pressure me. Both sides ended up breaking me badly, but nevertheless, I knew that it might have happened for a reason, and I hoped that it was a good one.
‚ÄúI want the white one, please. The one with the yellow smiley face.‚Äù She said, and I smiled and nodded. I took her hand in mine and gently kissed her palm.
‚ÄúRight away, my little princes.‚Äù
............
Dean:
‚ÄúYou seem distracted, my love.‚Äù My wife, Mariana, said, breaking my train of thoughts.
The amount of work that I had was overwhelming, and despite her knowing about it, she didn‚Äôt seem to really care. If anything, all she cared about was what she gained and what she was going to benefit, something that I found both selfish and annoying, but now was not the time to argue about it.
I looked at her over my shoulder, choosing not to want to respond. I had to work to tend to and the last thing I needed was for her and I to be arguing. And considering the fact that I knew that our conversation was going to end up turning into an argument to begin with, spoke a lot about how our marriage has been going over the past few years.
It has been five years since our marriage, and in this marriage, I came to believe that the two of us were indeed not fit for one another. 
The anger that I felt toward myself for letting go of a person who I knew was perfect for me was something that I could not deny; however, it was also something that I could not admit. I made my choice despite being warned and given the option not to go through with it, it was me who fought all the odds to simply be with a woman who saw me as nothing but a bank account for her to use.
It said more than a little that the two of us, despite being married for a long while and being together before it, didn‚Äôt bother starting a family. She did open up about it once, wanting to stabilize herself with me as a wife when everyone turned their backs on her or ended up showing her that she didn‚Äôt fit. However, I had to admit, it was me who resented it and didn‚Äôt want it with her.
‚ÄúDean, you have been off for months now and this is really getting out of hand.‚Äù Mariana said, breaking my train of thoughts. 
I took a deep breath, controlling my anger before turning around to face her. There was no point in upsetting her now, the woman that I wanted to get back to, my flower, was nowhere to be seen. I have fought for years to find her, but I wasn‚Äôt stupid, she was not in the city and did not want to be found; I would have found a trace of her otherwise.
Her father and I still worked together, and though I knew that he was disappointed and angry with me for breaking his daughter‚Äôs heart, the man chose to keep a professional distance between us. The man and I didn‚Äôt bring up the old issues, nor did he lash out on me once; however, he didn‚Äôt allow me to say his daughter‚Äôs name. It was something that I couldn‚Äôt blame him for. The woman did fight for me, it wasn‚Äôt something that I could deny. It was me who chose to resent and kick her out. It wasn‚Äôt her fault at all.
‚ÄúI have a lot to deal with, Mariana.‚Äù I said, cupping her cheeks, gently running my finger over them. 
I knew that she would end up causing an issue, and could even come to the company with that issue, and that was not something that I wanted. I didn‚Äôt need to see her in the building today, I knew that I would end up acting badly and that wasn‚Äôt something that I didn‚Äôt want. 
‚ÄúYou know the stress of work tends to get to me at times, and with the number of things that I have to deal with right now, I really need a break. Please don‚Äôt ask me too many questions that I don‚Äôt want to answer. I know that you want to help but, Mariana, my love, I need to be able to solve them on my own.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am here to support you, my love, but if you don‚Äôt open up to me to allow me to do so‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúMariana, the two of us are already aware that the two of us have our own worlds. And I for one do not like sharing my world of work nor do I like mixing it with my house.‚Äù I said, stopping her. 
The fact that she was initially my secretary meant many rumors had spread when I got a divorce and married her a month later. It was something that cost me a lot when it came to employees who have been fired for not respecting her, and to investors who chose to withdraw their stocks as they feared losing them considering that Iris‚Äôs father is my partner. 
Thankfully, the man was kind enough not to ruin my business for me as he kept going with the partnership, and though he didn‚Äôt mention it, I knew that it was Iris who might have spoken to him about it.
Some, if not most, said that she was the reason behind our divorce. Iris never answered them, and that came as a surprise. The woman simply claimed that it was a mutual divorce agreement, and though that wasn‚Äôt the case, she chose not to ruin my name.
It was something that I knew that Mariana wouldn‚Äôt do. Mariana would do her best to ruin me, my reputation, and family. But Iris proved to me that she wouldn‚Äôt harm me if it cost her everything, and I knew that our divorce has cost her a lot. If anything, it initially cost her the pain that she has put me through. It was something that I hated about myself, but I never tried changing it.
‚ÄúIt seems to me like you forgot that I was initially your secretary. If anyone would know how your work goes, Dean, it is me.‚Äù She said, crossing her arms over her chest. 
I rolled my eyes and walked to the bathroom, ignoring her attitude. The last thing I needed was to argue with her right now. It was bad enough that she was starting to ask me about the two of us conceiving. At first, it was me who wanted this. I wanted the two of us to build a family and I wanted to have an heir.
But the closer we get together, the more I resent the idea of building a family. And I couldn‚Äôt understand the reason behind it. Maybe my attraction toward her was just the fact that it was forbidden. But when we made it real, things just went crazy. The two of us just lost the fling between us, and that was not something that I could easily admit.
‚ÄúThat was in the past, Mariana. It is something that the two of us know.‚Äù I said, not bothering to look at her. I could tell that she was shaking her head at me behind me, but that was not something I cared about. I had work to tend to, and that was something that I knew; therefore, this marriage drama was not one that I was looking into.
I frowned as my phone rang, and I raised an eyebrow at the fact that it was my secretary. The woman never dared to call me when I was at home. It was due to Mariana scaring her not to do so. The threats that the woman got prevented her from thinking of looking at me rather than speaking to me.
If anything, the woman didn‚Äôt dare speak to me unless it was strictly work behavior, and I couldn‚Äôt blame Mariana for it. The woman was afraid that she would repeat the same past that she made Iris live through and that was something that I knew very well. It was something that I chose to excuse her for and for that, I walked out of the bedroom to take the call.
‚ÄúTell me, Sienna?‚Äù I asked, not bothering to greet the woman. I never did greet her anyway, so she wasn‚Äôt surprised by my response.
‚ÄúBoss, the men found her.‚Äù She said, and I frowned in confusion. 
Her next words took me off guard, making my heart drop to the stomach before I felt my breath getting caught in my throat. ‚ÄúThey found your ex, Ms. Iris‚Ä¶‚Äù

0,,7.65395E+14,1.19062E+14,the voice,OasisFun,"‚ÄúAnything exciting at work?‚Äù Kyle asked, blue eyes twinkling in the dimmed candlelight. He was sporting a suit three shades darker than his eyes, a white shirt underneath unbuttoned at the very top. His blond locks were combed back to perfection, framing his face.

I lift a shoulder in a shrug, my knife cutting through the grilled Branzino on my plate. ‚ÄúYou know Katerina Simone?‚Äù I asked, and brought my fork to my mouth. I moaned at the unbelievable taste of piquant basil, ginger, and lime. When I opened my eyes, Kyle was observing me, eyes dilated with an emotion I could not point out. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I wiped my mouth with the napkin.

Adam‚Äôs apple bobbing up and down, he reached for his wine.

‚ÄúStop moaning like that,‚Äù he said, lips hovering over his gltootshie.

I bit my lip, cheeks warming up.

Kyle and I had been together for two years and engaged for one, yet he never failed to make me blush.

Tucking my hair behind my ears, I reached for my own drink. His heated gaze made my mouth dry. He stared at me as though he couldn‚Äôt wait to strip this little black dress I‚Äôm wearing.

Hoping to get my mind back on track, I took in the fancy accent and framed artwork lining the wall. We are in one of the swankiest restaurants in Boston. Words go around that reservations here could take about a month or two, yet I doubt Kyle waited that long. Being one of Boston‚Äôs most sought out defense lawyers, Kyle was used to dining in places like this.

‚ÄúKaterina, Fernando Simone‚Äôs daughter?‚Äù he asked.

Dark midnight eyes held my gaze, a promise that this night would end better than the lemon pie for our dessert. I was so distracted by the way he was looking at me I‚Äôd forgotten what we were talking about.

‚ÄúShe walked into the office and specifically looked for me. She said,‚Äù I made a quotation in the air, ‚Äú‚ÄòGia told me you are the best in this field. I need you to work for me.‚Äô It was really weird since Gia Marquez, and I didn‚Äôt see eye to eye when I was working with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù Kyle murmured, brows tilting to the ceiling.

I hummed a yes.

For the last four years, I crawled up the ladder of Lewis Brown Public Relations from Intern to Account Coordinator and got promoted to Account Executive two years ago. On record, Gia Marquez is the most challenging client our team has ever handled. It‚Äôs funny how she could say a good word about me when she cursed me and my roots when I worked with her. She was a total larker, coming from old money, just like Katerina.

Shaking my head at the memory, I set down my gltootshie with a sigh.

‚ÄúYou accepted her,‚Äù Kyle commented. It‚Äôs one thing I love about Kyle. He can read me like the back of his hand. A crease in my brows, a sigh, a pout. I don‚Äôt know how he does that, but he just gets me.

‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù I traced the mouth of my gltootshie with my fingers, shoulders slouching. ‚ÄúGeorgia gave me two choices: accept Katerina or take this billionaire client in Rio.‚Äù

Georgia, my senior account executive, candidly dislikes me for unknown reasons.

Kyle reached across the table, taking my hand. He stroked my knuckles with his thumb. ‚ÄúYou made it this far, and this is your dream job. Don‚Äôt let Georgia stop you from reaching your goal.‚Äù Our eyes locked, and his sincerity caressed my heart the way his thumb did to my knuckles. ‚ÄúI know a good way to help you relax,‚Äù he smirked.

Like an obedient puppy, my mind instantly shoved away what worries it was constructing. I gripped Kyle‚Äôs hand, tilting it up, my fingertips tracing his palm lines. Pressing both elbows on the table, I lowered my voice and asked, ‚Äúoh yeah?‚Äù

He huffed, setting down his empty gltootshie and catching my wandering fingers. ‚ÄúSounds like you are challenging me, Baby Girl.‚Äù

Oh, he‚Äôs in the mood.

~~

Kyle shaved a good five minutes off from what typically takes a thirty minute drive from the city to his upstate mansion. After parking unceremoniously at the roundabout, Kyle slid out, opened the door for me, and basically plucked me from my seat. He trapped me against the door after shutting it with a thud, plowing his fingers through my hair, smashing our lips together. His soft lips tasted of wine with a pinch of lemon pie.

‚ÄúYou will be sick tomorrow,‚Äù he said, biting my lower lip, his hard-on pressing on my hip bone.

Mind fogged with lust, I pulled away to confirm if I had heard him correctly. ‚ÄúAre you a mind reader now, Atty. Andrews?‚Äù

He gripped my jaw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll screwing ruin you tonight, Sofia,‚Äù he stated, eyes skimming down my body. ‚ÄúYou know I go crazy seeing your legs like this, yet you chose this sinfully short dress on a workday date night.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. Empty promises were not Kyle‚Äôs forte. Georgia would kill me if I called in sick on a Wednesday, especially after taking on an important client like Katerina.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I had in mind when I chose this.‚Äù I clutched the lapel of his suit.

Kyle groaned, gripping my hand. In a handful of steps, we are inside his mansion. Kyle yanked me to face him, grabbed my jaw, and smashed our lips together. He groaned impatiently as I parted my lips, letting him deepen the kiss. He kept steering us through the house until my butt bumped into a hard edge.

With the help of the warm corner lights, I realized he had brought us to the kitchen, my back resting on the edge of the kitchen island.

‚ÄúTell me you‚Äôre mine.‚Äù He kissed his way down my throat, palming my bare with one hand, the other reaching for the side zipper of my dress.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours, all yours,‚Äù I said, gasping as the cool wind blasted my skin, following the ripping sound of my dress.

Kyle‚Äôs demonstration of strength stirred my excitement to a new height. He spun me around with an impatient growl, skipping all foreplay. He ripped my black thongs, the ruined fabric joining my dress around my feet. The fumbling of his belt was music to my ears. Warm hands trailed down my spine, guiding me to bend over the island.

And there, Kyle proved he was a man of his word; the ruining comment might have been an understatement. He marked me, owned me just like every time we were together.

Through the desire overdose, we reached his bedroom and slept in each other‚Äôs arms, spent yet satisfied.

In the middle of the night, I woke up with a dire need to pee. When I went back to bed, the continuous blinking of Kyle‚Äôs phone on the nightstand grabbed my attention.

Thinking it was an emergency, I neared the bed to wake him up. My body froze when I saw the notification on his locked screen.

‚ÄòI warned you, Kyle.‚Äô

‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell her myself if you can‚Äôt.‚Äô

Curiosity getting the best of me, I unlocked his phone with my birthday; what I read ruined me, indeed.

..............................................................................
‚ÄòI‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äô

‚ÄòAre you sure it‚Äôs mine?‚Äô

‚ÄòAre you calling me a liar? Babies happen when you have sex, Kyle. And we did more than just have sex. We screwed!‚Äô

‚ÄòYou sound so sure I am the father. I don‚Äôt remember a screwing thing about that night!‚Äô I gathered through my blurry sight. It was Kyle‚Äôs response to the image of a pregnancy test result.

It‚Äôs ironic how parallel lines could light up the future I had built with Kyle in flames and turn it to ash.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. There seemed to be an oxygen shortage inside the room. My chest caved as questions filled my head. ‚ÄòWhat the heck is happening? Kyle? My Kyle. My fiance got another woman pregnant?‚Äô

Reaching the end of the thread that started more than a month ago, I finally had the guts to look at the display profile on the chat.

A strangled sob escaped my lips. I covered my mouth, my hand touching my wet cheeks.

It was Katerina Simone.

My fiance was the father of her child. Behind closed doors, she told Georgia and me what kind of service she‚Äôd require from us.

‚ÄòI am pregnant,‚Äô Katerina said. ‚ÄòAnd I don‚Äôt want the public to know about my pregnancy until after my wedding.‚Äô

At LBPR, we live for these kinds of stories. You‚Äôd be surprised at the cost people would pay to maintain their perfect image.

‚ÄòTheir names are worth more than their fortune,‚Äô that‚Äôs what Chairman Lewis used to say.

In this case, Katerina has more than an image to protect. She chose me with intent. It‚Äôs not because of my excellent work at keeping Gia Marquez‚Äôs secret relationship with a governor. By coming to me, she made a statement to Kyle.

‚ÄúBabe,‚Äù Kyle‚Äôs sleep-laced voice snapped me out of my trance.

I lifted my gaze to him, not even bothering to wipe my tears.

He opened the bedside lamp, rubbing the sleep off his eyes. It took him about five seconds to take in my appearance.

‚ÄúWhy are you crying?‚Äù His eyes landed on my hand, clutching his phone. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with you and Katerina?‚Äù I‚Äôd like to give myself a pat on the back for not stuttering.

A tag of war was happening inside my head. One part believed that he would never do this to me. And the other tells me to wake the screw up; the evidence was ready to bite me in the face.

He sat on the edge of the bed and took his phone, brows creasing as he scanned what was on display.

I clenched my fist. The sadness in my chest was slowly morphing into anger. A black hole was quickly sucking the future I dreamt of building with him. The kids, the waking up together and coming home to each other every night‚Ä¶ This was the man I was supposed to marry.

‚ÄòHow did this happen to us?‚Äô

He was my end game, or so I thought.

He placed his phone on the nightstand, stretched to his full height, and reached for me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it seems.‚Äù

I snorted, wiggling my hand from his grip, but it was to no avail. He hooked a finger beneath my chin, forcing me to look up at him. The reticent light in his room revealed his pleading blue eyes. ‚ÄúBaby, let me explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúExplain what? Everything I needed to know was in that conversation.‚Äù My entire body was trembling. A tsunami of emotions spiraled down my spine. ‚ÄúYou woke up next to her, bare‚Ä¶ in your childhood bedroom. She‚Äôs two months pregnant, and you kept all of this from me!‚Äù

‚ÄúBaby, I don‚Äôt remember that night. I was screwing wasted,‚Äù he said, skimming his hand over his face. The realness of the situation made breathing a struggle. Kyle has always been tootshieertive, and he is anything but a light weight. How could I believe a word he was saying?

‚ÄúAre you sure you didn‚Äôt screw her because she sounds so screwing sure, Kyle?‚Äù Those words left a bitter taste on my tongue.

His silence was my answer. I took a sharp breath, stepping away from him as though his proximity was suffocating me.

Kyle exhaled. I hate that he still looked calm and collected while here I am, a crying mess. ‚ÄúJust give me time. I will fix this situation.‚Äù

I faced him. ‚ÄúHow can you fix this situation, Kyle, huh? I bet your mom would be ecstatic to know about Katerina‚Äôs pregnancy.‚Äù

He lowered his head, blowing a deep breath. ‚ÄúShe already knows, doesn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Since he introduced me to his family, his mom‚Äôs animosity towards me was as clear as a cloudless sky. Kyle‚Äôs family came from old money. And being the only son of a lawyer and a doctor, his mom wanted him to marry one of her amiga‚Äôs daughters. ‚ÄòA girl from high society,‚Äô she once blatantly said in my face, not some publicist working nine to five.

I wiped my tears. ‚ÄúI bet she‚Äôs already planning your wedding with Katerina.‚Äù

Kyle reached for me, but I stepped back. ‚ÄúSofia... you‚Äôre the one I want to marry. Please, don‚Äôt do this to us. I will figure something out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who did this to us! I love you, but this is too much. I need space. I need time to think.‚Äù

Something dangerous crossed his face. ‚ÄúIf you leave now, I won‚Äôt be chasing you.‚Äù

Of all the things he‚Äôd say, that line never crossed my mind.

‚ÄúMom threatened to disown me if I didn‚Äôt marry Katerina. And you leaving me this way...‚Äù his long lash gaze pierced my soul when he met my eyes. ‚ÄúI have nothing left to lose.‚Äù

My mouth ran dry. How could he reverse the situation as if I were the one ending this relationship? I am not the one who slept with Katerina!

‚ÄúI was ready to give up everything for you... if you leave me now, you will lose me forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you seriously giving me an ultimatum?‚Äù

He raked his hair roughly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been fighting for this relationship, Sofia. All I am asking is time to fix this, and you can‚Äôt even give me that.‚Äù

Confrontations had always been Kyle‚Äôs expertise. He could twist the law in his sleep. He always finds a loophole, and he‚Äôs using that to his advantage.

My anger got the best of me. I jutted my chin up, meeting his gaze defiantly. ‚ÄúWell, you don‚Äôt have to fight for anything anymore, Kyle.‚Äù

..............................................................................
The sun is not up yet. I glanced left to right on the empty street, shifting from one foot to another. This is the last place I‚Äôd see myself after breaking my engagement off.

Drawing in a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell to Georgia‚Äôs place. The silence of this neighborhood was sullen, and her footsteps as she approached the door were like a drum roll to the plot twist of my story.

‚ÄúThis better be a life and death-‚Äú her sleep-laced voice halted as she took in my appearance. ‚ÄúWhat the heck happened to you, Sofia?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I glanced down at Kyle‚Äôs shirt and joggers. They swallow my small frame like a blanket. My hair was a tangled mess, no less, and my face was no better. ‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù

Without missing a beat, she stepped aside and allowed me in.

She led me to the kitchen. I sat on the stool by the breakfast bar while Georgia busied herself on the coffee machine. As the machine purred gently, she faced me and crossed her arms. ‚ÄúYou are here for a reason.‚Äù

I sighed. Georgia is the last person I‚Äôd confide in about my problems. We are not friends. She doesn‚Äôt like me for a reason I still can‚Äôt figure out, but she holds my ticket out of this town. ‚ÄúI want the client in Rio.‚Äù

Her perfectly shaped brows twitched. It was so small I barely missed it. The coffee machine beeped. Each second, as she filled two cups of coffee, dragged slowly.

She offered me a cup, taking the chair across from mine. She sipped her coffee slowly, peering at me over her cup. ‚ÄúConvince me to give it to you.‚Äù

On the way here, I had already perfected the story I would give her, but I didn‚Äôt think lying to Georgia would get me anywhere, so I told her the truth.

‚ÄúI know you hate me, but I really need to get away from here,‚Äù I added when she kept silent. I‚Äôd like to give myself a pat on the shoulder to not cry in front of my boss.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ‚Äòhate‚Äô you,‚Äù she said, her voice gentle and careful.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like me,‚Äù I pressed.

‚ÄúYes, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù she chuckled, tucking her fiery red hair behind her ears.

I let out a breath, ready to make my case, but she surprised me again by saying, ‚Äúyou got the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I asked, bewildered. ‚ÄúUhm, thank you.‚Äù I kept my composure when deep inside, I was celelarkering this small victory.

Georgia nodded, sipping her coffee.

‚ÄúOne question,‚Äù I said, hoping this won‚Äôt affect her decision. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I see myself in you, Sofia.‚Äù

~~

I had never been a light traveler. Packing my necessities in two hours was a record-breaking success in my lifetime.

Throughout the drive to the airport, Georgia‚Äôs words played like a song out of tune in my head. I didn‚Äôt press on what she meant by it. She volunteered to cover for me in the office and why the sudden change of plans. I didn‚Äôt ask why she was so willing to help me. She had her reasons, and I had mine. As long as I get to get away from here, I don‚Äôt mind what hidden agenda Georgia has.

The sun was already up when I reached the airport. Georgia promised our company driver, Efraim, would meet me there with my plane ticket and client files. I have no idea how she‚Äôll get me a flight on short notice, but I have to trust her.

With his bald head and beer belly, Efraim wasn‚Äôt hard to spot in the crowd, even though he was three inches shorter than me. Holding a manila envelope in one hand, he waved and offered a huge grin.

‚ÄúMs. G said you‚Äôre leaving?‚Äù he asked, ptootshieing the envelope.

‚ÄúFor business,‚Äù I said, avoiding a longer conversation with Efraim. ‚ÄúGeorgia got me a flight?‚Äù I asked, looking for a plane ticket inside the envelope, brows furrowing when I found none.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Efraim answered, chuckling.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù panic rose from the pit of my belly.

I don‚Äôt expect Kyle to come after me, but I‚Äôd like to avoid any confrontation with him if I could. If he changed his mind, he had the resources to know where to find me.

‚ÄúShe got you a private jet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I repeated my question in a whisper.

~~

Bewildered, I sat on the flush gray leather seat, taking in the palatial interior of Mr. Montiero‚Äôs private jet. In front of me was a gltootshie table and another set of 2 chairs. Wedge on the other side of the plane was a comfy-looking long couch. It appears to be softer than the bed I sleep in every night.

‚ÄúMiss Collins, would you like tea, coffee, water?‚Äù a very attractive, groomed, blond young woman, smiled pleasantly. She wore the sharpest charcoal suit jacket and white shirt I had ever seen.

‚ÄúA gltootshie of water, thank you,‚Äù I said, suddenly feeling thirsty.

She looked thoughtful for a while, taking my appearance in. Thinking I‚Äôd be flying on an economy flight, I dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. I‚Äôm beginning to wish I didn‚Äôt wear my sneakers and put a little makeup on my puffy cheeks and eyes.

‚ÄúMay I also offer you breakfast, Miss Collins? It is a long flight to Rio,‚Äù she said, a gentle smile on her lips.

I considered her offer, glancing at the couch behind her. Eyes taking in the stunning white, gray, and black accentuated interior of the jet and the clear blue sky through the window as we flew above the clouds, I lowered my voice and asked, ‚Äúwould it be okay if I sleep on that couch?‚Äù

She glanced at the couch and back at me. ‚ÄúThe cabin is much more comfortable for a rest,‚Äù she said.

My eyes probably lit up like a New Year‚Äôs Eve at her words.

~~

I was rejuvenated when we landed in Rio. The private jet had its own bathroom, complete with a shower and tub, which I wish to enjoy if there was a repeat of this experience.

A car was already waiting for me on the tarmac.

‚ÄòJust how rich is this client?‚Äô I haven‚Äôt opened the files since Efraim handed it to me. I don‚Äôt even know what job they‚Äôd require me to do.

‚ÄúWhere to Miss?‚Äù The driver in a black and white suit surprised me.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I asked, meeting his eyes through the rearview mirror.

His brown eyes watched me carefully before he said, ‚Äúto the office or the penthouse.‚Äù

‚ÄúPenthouse?‚Äù I parroted, baffled.

‚ÄúUh, yes?‚Äù he tilted his head to the side. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be staying at one of Mr. Montiero‚Äôs penthouses.‚Äù

‚Äúdang,‚Äù I murmured, catching myself too late.

The driver chuckled, his eyes crinkling on the side. ‚ÄúI gathered you haven‚Äôt read his file yet?‚Äù

I only noticed then that he had a perfect American accent even though he had those sexy, deep Brazilian eyes and sharp jaws. His dark curly hair was neatly brushed back, yet a few strands mischievously fell on his forehead.

Cheeks reddening, I shook my head.

Throwing an arm on the back of the ptootshieenger seat, he faced me. His smile was bedazzling.

‚ÄúLet me give you a brief background about the boss. The ones before you didn‚Äôt even last a week. They studied his behavior for months, pitched big plans, and promised the board they could change his image.‚Äù He chuckled, turning to start the car. The gentle hum of the engine brought me back to reality.

Since he already knew my secret of coming here unprepared, I dared ask. ‚ÄúWhat image do I need to change, exactly?‚Äù

The man chuckled. ‚ÄúSee for yourself.‚Äù

Ben Davison spends some time looking at the Robodebt Royal Commission report, the scathing rebuke of the Morrison government, the potential crimes of former ministers and the culture of cooperation between corporate and billionaire owned media and the Coalition of treating people in need as less than human.

Ben explains why Robodebt was bad policy, how we avoid such policies in the future and why unions calling for a more secure public sector workforce are part of the solution.

Join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

The Health Services Union (HSU) in NSW has won a pay rise of up to 8.5% for its lowest paid members and Ben explains how this union has tackled the issue of low paid ""essential workers"" and won.

The Commonwealth has also announced changes to teacher education over the next two years so Ben has a look at why that's happened, why we need to fix the Morrison era funding set ups and what impact it has on productivity.

CANBERRA: Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham has penned a letter to Australia's Foreign Minister, Penny Wong for the first time on an issue of concern to Armenian-Australians, reported the Armenian National Committee of Australia. 

The letter addressed to Minister Wong was sent on 28 June 2023, one day prior to the 200th day of Azerbaijan's siege on Artsakh, and expressed serious concern over the ‚Äúongoing threat to civilians in Nagorno Karabakh‚Äù.

In his letter, Senator Birmingham raised Australia‚Äôs questionable silence on the issue requesting a response as to why Australia has not yet joined its fellow democratic allies in releasing a statement calling on Azerbaijan to open the ""road of life"" for the people of Artsakh. 

This is now the second occasion Senator Birmingham has probed the Government to take action on the Artsakh Blockade and publicly declare Canberra's protest in a statement, the first being earlier in May this year during Senate Estimates hearings. 

The letter read: ‚ÄúI write to seek your advice on the information you have received regarding the blockade and checkpoint, and the basis for the Australian Government‚Äôs decision to not join partners in making a public statement calling for the blockade to be lifted.‚Äù 

The Senator for South Australia and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, wrote  to the ANC-AU referencing his ""letter to the Foreign Minister seeking a strong
Australian statement in support of opening Lachin Corridor‚Äù.

In his letter to the ANC-AU, Senator Birmingham also spoke to the ICJ‚Äôs provisional measure ordering Azerbaijan to ""protect prisoners of war, prevent racial hatred and discrimination against
Armenians, and prevent and punish acts of vandalism and desecration affecting Armenian cultural heritage"".

In response to the Orders by the ICJ, Birmingham said ‚ÄúThis measure is strongly supported by the Coalition, which continues to support a halt to actions that escalate conflict in the region, and to support genuine engagement in the current peace negotiations.‚Äù

Armenian National Committee of Australia (ANC-AU) Executive Director Michael Kolokossian wrote to Senator Birmingham thanking him for this principled position and standing with a grassroots community. 

Kolokossian said, ‚ÄúThis is the first time an Australian Foreign Affairs spokesperson from one of the major two parties has directly written to their counterpart expressing serious concern over the developing situation in Artsakh and is accepted with gratitude by each member of our community, who continue to raise this matter with their elected representatives.‚Äù

Kolokossian said, ‚ÄúNews of this letter will give many in the wider Armenian-Australian community hope. Hope that Australia can stand with its allies and raise its voice on human rights violations, no matter where they may be prosecuted or by who.‚Äù

It is public land and before 2009 it was zoned for Public Use and Recreation.

Now, federally listed threatened species like the Gouldian Finch and Black-footed tree rats, 300 year old woolly butt trees, the last remaining savanna corridor to Darwin and a spot beloved by thousands from Larrakia people to twitchers across the globe is due to be bulldozed.

 It's due to be bulldozed because a Territory politician decided to sign an agreement with  a Federal Statutory body in 2016 for commercial housing. (Commercial housing unsuited to a tropical climate, paid for by the public, on public land and with the majority being sold for a profit.)

Since that agreement was signed behind closed doors, Lee Point's fate was politically sealed.

Ever since then, the cracks in our planning and environmental laws locally and federally have been revealed as massive gaping holes.

There are no adequate laws to protect what is naturally and culturally valuable. 

The community, made up of traditional owners, scientists, families, doctors, lawyers, bird watchers, and lee point lovers alike, have worked tirelessly to have their voice heard.

Our political and legal system has no genuine mechanism to hear the community's voice.

The model proposed for the Voice to Parliament is not a ‚Äúmodest change‚Äù, nor is it ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù.  It is a major change that has no detail and that would be permanent.
There is no indication of how the Voice will make practical changes to underprivileged Indigenous people, and the country‚Äôs best legal minds are divided on what the High Court will be called to adjudicate on.
It is not true that a majority of Indigenous people support this - in Northern Queensland, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are saying that the Voice can‚Äôt properly represent the diverse needs and views of the many different communities.

Derek POV
""""Whiskey."""" The bartender called. I turned back to the counter, reaching for the drink, when someone snatched it before I could get to it.
""""Hey that's mine-"""" I started to protest, my words falling short when my eyes laid on her. The coconut and vanilla scent were wafting off of her.
""""Mate!"""" Dean yelled in my head.
""""It can't be...""""
""""Oh, I'm sorry-"""" She started but stopped, gasping, when her big brown eyes laid on mine. Any thoughts I had about returning to the women at my table were soon forgotten.
""""Its fine."""" I said, taking calculated steps towards her, stalking my prey. She had long, silky black hair, and was about 5'6'', maybe a little less on account of the high heels she had on. She wore a black long-sleeved top and black mini skirt with fishnet stockings and a fake set of cat ears on top of her head. Her makeup matched her outfit, making her look like a black cat.
""""Split it with me?"""" She said, batting her eyes at me. Her face turned bright red the moment I took it from her.
I took a big gulp then placed the glass on her lips. """"Finish it,"""" I said, licking my lips. She hesitated but obeyed, downing the rest. I could see her eyes studying me, not sure what to make of me. Being an Alpha made me bigger and stronger than most. 
I stood at a comfortable six foot four, my body well sculpted from years of exercise and a killer metabolism. I had thick brown tousled hair, looking more on the wild side than the professional side most days. Add in a pair of vibrant green eyes and, well, I was a lady killer.
""""Do you want to..."""" She started to ask but blushed again and hung her head, avoiding looking at me.
I took her chin between my thumb and pointer fingers, tilting it up to face me. """"Do I want to what?"""" I asked, stepping closer to her.
She took a deep, steadying breath. """"Wanna get out of here?"""" She said, her eyes filled with passion.
""""My place or yours?"""" I whispered into her ear, my teeth grazing the soft flesh of her neck.
""""Yours."""" She shivered, her hands grabbing onto me for stability.
""""Let's go."""" I winked, and she smiled. I led her slowly to the front entrance, my hand on the small of her back.
""""Jeff, keys, now"""" I ordered via mind link. By the time we got to the front, Jeff was waiting for me, keys in hand, his blond hair a wild mess, his shirt untucked and belt unbuckled. I owed him. He tossed me the keys, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. I gave him a curt nod, a smirk on my own face.
I led the way to the car, opening the door for my girl to get in. I shut the door behind her before hopping into the driver's seat and heading for my penthouse in the city. I rested my hand on her exposed thigh, sparks erupting underneath my touch. I must be imagining. Maybe I'm more drunk than I thought.
""""I'm never like this."""" She blurted out.
""""Like what?"""" I asked, my eyes fixated on the road.
""""I don't normally do stuff like this."""" She waived her hand around the car.
""""Sit in a car?"""" I said sarcastically, deciding to play with my food.
""""No"""" She huffed. """"Go home with strangers.""""
""""I'm Derek."""" I lifted my hand from her thigh and held it out for her to shake.
""""Valerie."""" She answered, shaking my hand.
""""It's nice to meet you."""" I smiled.
""""You also."""" She laughed. It was music to my ears.
""""There, now we aren't strangers."""" I said, returning my hand to her thigh.
I pulled up to the condominium where my penthouse was located. Putting the car in park, I got out and opened the door for Valerie, helping her step out. I threw my keys to the bellman who stood outside waiting and led Valerie inside.
""""So what pack are you from?"""" I asked, escorting her to the elevators.
""""Pack? I mean I go to Georgia Coastal College if that's what you mean. I'm not in a sorority though."""" She shrugged, stepping inside the elevator with me.
""""You're not...?""""
""""Not what?"""" She asked.
""""Never mind."""" I said, shaking my head.
Something was wrong. I must be crazy or maybe she is. The moon Goddess wouldn't give me, an Alpha King, a human as a mate. I definitely drank too much. I was downing shots like they were candy. My wolf metabolism must be slowing down, or maybe I'm just dreaming. The elevators dinged and opened, leading directly to my penthouse. The view was amazing, which Valerie took notice of immediately.
""""Make yourself at home. I'll be right back."""" I said, discarding my jacket onto the back of one of my dining room chairs. That was its primary purpose, after all, being a coat hanger. I made my way into the kitchen, grabbing a fresh bottle of whiskey and two glasses. I met Valerie back in my living room, finding her staring out the window. I opened the bottle and poured us both a glass, which she gladly took and began nursing. """"We don't have to do anything if you don't want to."""" I said, her body language telling me she was nervous. She kept shifting from one foot to the other and avoided eye contact.
""""I want to."""" She said without hesitating.
""""You're sure?"""" I asked again.
""""MH"""" she hummed, finishing off her drink in a few big gulps. """"Definitely. This is just a bit new for me."""" Her cheeks heated up from the drink or embarrassment. I wasn't sure.
""""Well, alright then."""" I said, taking her empty glass and setting it down next to mine. I closed the gap between us, placing my hands on her hips. Her hands found my chest and gently clawed down my body. I could feel myself getting lost in her beautiful chocolate brown eyes.
""""Alright then."""" She said, biting her lip and pressing her chest against me ever so slightly.
My lips crashed down onto hers, devouring her. Our limbs tangled together, tearing away at each other's clothes, feeling every inch of one another. 
When the sun started to make its appearance on the horizon, exhaustion finally took over and we fell asleep tangled in the sheets together. Best. Birthday. Ever.
Valerie POV
Last night was the best night of my entire life. I went to the club to hang out with some friends and distract myself from my everyday problems. What I didn't expect was to leave with someone. 
To go back to his place and have the best intercourse of my entire life. I felt so connected to Derek, it was strange. I would never sleep with someone on a first date, let alone after a two-minute encounter at a nightclub! But everything about him drew me in. His looks, his voice, his cologne, his touch, especially his touch.
I flipped over, staring at the most gorgeous man I had ever laid my eyes on. Now that daylight was peeking through the window and I was no longer tipsy, I was able to get a good look at all of his features. He screamed masculinity, something I was wildly attracted to. 
He was breathing deeply, still sound asleep from our late night of intercourse. The sheets fell around his waist, leaving his impeccable torso wide open. I wanted to lick his chiseled body, again. I settled for snuggling into his side. I wonder if he would want my number? 
Maybe we could meet for coffee or something. I would even be down for another night like last night with this man. My legs were still shaky and my center still throbbing from his repeated intrusion.
My less than pure thoughts were interrupted when something caught my eye. A scar a few inches thick on his side, and another on his shoulder blade. I sat up, taking a closer look. He had many old wounds actually. What did he do to get all of these? 
My mind began conjuring up a hundred awful reasons as to why he would have gotten all of these. Gang member? Ex prison? Mercenary? Hit man? I can't deal with this. No baggage for me, thank you very much, no matter how mind-blowing the intercourse was. 
I was finally getting into a better place in my life and I wasn't going to blow it by pursuing someone with major issues. I quickly snuck out of bed, grabbing my clothing and preparing for the walk of shame. My heart ran the show more than a few times and look where that landed me. 
Time to let my brain take the lead. I carefully crept out of the room, taking one last lingering look from the doorway before grabbing a cab and heading back home.
Derek POV
I woke up feeling well rested for the first time in months, no, years. Was I dreaming last night? What happened? I had a mild headache, undoubtedly from the copious amounts of beverage I consumed last night. 
I remember working late, Jeff coming to the office, going to the nightclub, lots of drinks...a few women...and her. Valerie. She couldn't have possibly been my mate, she was human if I'm not mistaken, which I hardly ever am these days.
""""She was our mate."""" Dean chimed in, still feeling well satisfied.
""""How can you be so sure?""""
""""How are you not sure? She smelled heavenly, sparks erupted wherever we touched, we connected with her and she gave us the best intercourse of our entire life."""" He added. Goddess, if I could see him now, he would probably be lounging in bed smoking a cigar with a smug look on his face.
I sat up in bed, throwing my feet over the edge, grabbing my phone and checking my messages. I was shocked to see that I had slept in late, it was almost eleven am. I had a mountain of paperwork to get through. Most of my messages were from Jeff, one from my Delta, Matt, about the training schedule, and a missed call from the council. 
Today was already turning out to be bad. Maybe I should just go back to bed. I stood up and headed to the bathroom, stepping on something on the way. I bent down and picked up a pair of cat ears. My Kittens. Flashbacks from last night flew through my head. Goddess, she was perfect. After rubbing one out in the shower, I made my way over to the office, preparing myself to put out fires.
""""There you are! How was last night?"""" Jeff patted me on the back, falling in step with me as I made my way to my office.
My grim expression turned up for a moment at the thought of last night. """"It exceeded my expectations."""" I smirked.
""""Way to hit it man!"""" Jeff said coyly. """"Listen, I hate to spoil your morning, but there is something you need to know-""""
""""King Derek, how nice of you to join us."""" Councilman Howard said, unamused, standing in my doorway.
""""Councilman, what an unexpected surprise. What brings you here?""""
""""Don't play dumb boy, you know why we are here."""" He said, stepping back inside my office.
I followed him in. The rest of the council were spread out in the room, all except my brother-in-law, King Edward, who was an exception. At least until his twins became the reigning kings, which would be in the next few years now. 
I set my things down on my desk, preparing myself for the scolding I was about to receive.
""""You haven't chosen a mate,"""" Councilwoman Leslie announced.
""""Obviously,"""" I retorted, not in the mood for games.
""""You would be wise to change your tone, boy."""" Councilman Charles said, raising his voice.
""""Why must I choose a mate? Am I not a worthy enough king?"""" I addressed the room.
""""It will strengthen your already weakened kingdom. We have given you enough time to find your mate or choose another. Time is nearly up. You have one year to pick your Luna and Queen or we will pick for you."""" Councilman Howard said, leaving no room for debate. 
He, along with the rest of the council, stood and filed out of my office. """"One year,"""" he reiterated, before slamming my office door shut. I only had one year to find my mate? It took some wolves a lifetime!
""""We have already found our mate,"""" Dean noted, as if I were stupid.
""""We were drunk, that wasn't her.""""
""""Keep living in denial then."""" He said annoyingly.
Knock Knock Knock
""""Alpha? You wanted to see me?"""" Trish knocked at my door.
""""Come in."""" I said, my eyes still glued to the paperwork in front of me.
""""Is everything okay?"""" She sat down in the chair across from me.
""""Yes, well no. I need your help. I need an assistant. Someone who can keep track of my schedule and messages and maybe even bring me coffee. Do you think you could hire someone?"""" I peered up from my papers.
""""Absolutely!"""" She breathed a sigh of relief, flipping her blond hair over her shoulder. """"Anything else?"""" She asked.
""""No, that will be all."""" I dismissed her. 
The next day
I said hello to Liz and a few others on my way to my desk. Jeff stopped me on the way and asked me to look over something at the loading dock. I set my things down and went to help him, but not before my nose caught a familiar scent. No, it couldn't be. Someone must be wearing perfume or something. I dismissed it and continued along to go help Jeff. When I returned to my office, I noticed a set of keys and a phone resting on the once vacant reception desk. Trish must have finally hired someone.
My ears twitched, hearing a lot of rustling coming from the normally quiet kitchen around the corner from my office. I followed the sound, my nose picking up the same familiar scent. It got stronger and stronger the closer I got, I had to use a lot of self-control not to run towards it. Quietly, I peeked into the kitchen and just watched.
""""Mate! Mate! It's mate!"""" Dean yelled in my head while running in circles.
I knew immediately who she was, Valerie. The best one-night stand of my life, and regrettably, my mate. She was even more beautiful than I had remembered. But Goddess, what was she doing here? She didn't work here...did she?
""""Valerie?"""" I said, taking a few steps forward.
Her head snapped up and looked over at me. """"Derek?! Ouch!"""" She said, holding her now bleeding hand. """"Ugh! I can't even!"""" She hissed in pain and frustration. My chest hurt for my mate, only further proving the moon goddess had a sick sense of humor towards my life. Of course, my mate would be a human.
""""She remembered us..."""" Dean swooned.
""""I would hope so, she screamed out our name enough times."""" I smirked.
""""Here, let me see."""" I said, carefully taking her hand in mine and looking over the damage. She definitely didn't hold back. She could probably use a few stitches in fact. But even with her injury, sparks erupted over my skin when we touched.
""""What are you doing here?"""" She asked.

Ben also discusses the passing of the referendum bill, the decision by Lidia Thorpe to support the NO case and breaks down the three different, equally bad, arguments for voting NO.  Remembering that a referendum is a binary choice and that only a YES vote moves reconciliation forward.

Meet Thomas Mayo.

He's a member of the PM's Referendum Working Group.

He signed off on the words Labor wants to put into our Constitution.

He wrote the handbook to the Voice to Parliament and is one of the 'YES' campaign's leading public advocates.

The PM argues on repeat that the Voice is a ""modest request"" from Indigenous Australians.

But Thomas Mayo said it will be used to ""punish politicians"", ""abolish colonialist institutions"" and ""pay the rent"", which means ""reparations and compensation"".

He said ""there is nothing that we can do that is more powerful than building a first nations' Voice, a black institution, a black political force to be reckoned with"".

At a 2021 Invasion Day protest he said he was ""sick of governments not listening to our voice"" so planned ""to use the rulebook of the nation to force them"".

Over the coming weeks, Victorian Socialists volunteers will be out and about across Melbourne talking to residents about how we can ensure our city and local communities work for everyone, not just the wealthy few.

We think that today, increasingly, they don't, and that this is due to the sacrifice of basic human needs to the pursuit of private profit‚Äîa sacrifice in which the major parties have, over many decades, been complicit.

The housing crisis is perhaps the clearest and most immediate aspect of this, but that crisis can't be understood in isolation from the broader dynamics of this profit-driven system.

Victorians Socialists believe it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. It‚Äôs ordinary people that make our cities and communities run, not the occupants of high political offices and corporate boardrooms. It‚Äôs us, not them, that should run the city.

Were this to happen, our priorities would be very different to those pursued by big business and their representatives in government today. We could create a city for people, not profit.

Victorian Socialists want to be part of that. We want to help bring together all those concerned with the state of our cities and communities and start to give voice to a vision of how things could be different from the profit-driven status quo.

Van Badham and Ben Davison explore the broken philosophy of The RBA that denies profiteering is a problem until everyone else has said it is, continues to believe in a wage-price spiral that doesn't exist and both simultaneously says people should get more work but we need less people employed.  

Of course the union movement was among the first to point out the fallacies of the RBA's ideology and continues to win better pay and conditions so join at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben and Van also examine how Japan's monetary policy is structured and the outcomes that can be achieved when the high priests of Milton Friedman are no longer in charge.

The Greens have delayed the Housing Affordability Future Fund until at least October.  

Ben and Van look at the arguments, break down the math and try to get a better understanding whether it is politicking or ignorance that is driving The Greens to upend millions of dollars in social housing funding.

The referendum legislation has passed parliament meaning that the government must call a referendum within six months.  Van and Ben discuss the campaign so far, the work being done for a big national YES day on July 2nd and offer solidarity to those being attacked by the billionaire and corporate owned media for daring to have a Voice.

The good news is that despite the misinformation and vast corporate media NO machine the YES vote is ahead.  Ben and Van look at some polling, some analysis and give their views.

You can become a supporter at www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday and while you're there send us a question for Ben to answer on the Weekend Wrap this Sunday.

This image of a feral cat with its teeth through the neck of a quoll is heartbreaking. Unfortunately this quoll is not the only animal killed by cats. The stats are jaw-dropping üòß Each year in Australia, new peer-reviewed evidence has revealed cats kill:

Later this year, Australians will be able to vote at a referendum and complete our Constitution.

A successful YES vote will recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the Constitution and create a voice to help close the gap.

Despite being one of the most successful nations in the world, on too many measures, our Indigenous brothers and sisters are not sharing the same outcomes as other Australians:

¬∑ The life expectancy of an Indigenous Australian is eight years below that of other Australians.  

¬∑ The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is estimated to be about 9 times higher than their fellow Australians.

¬∑ One in five Indigenous households are living in accommodation that does not meet an acceptable standard.

¬∑ The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is almost two and half times that of other Australians, and

¬∑ Young Indigenous males are more likely to end up in jail, than attending a university.

By writing YES we can help change this.

The Voice is a practical change that will help local and regional communities across Australia.

I will be supporting the YES case because it is a safe constitutional change, and it will make a meaningful difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander Australians.

Over the months ahead, I am looking forward to being part of a movement of Australians from all political backgrounds and playing a part in a campaign that will bring our country together.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=212701317870241

Because of the need to find a niche in an oversaturated media landscape, many young political and journalism professionals are pushed into selling themselves as a bi resource. I get it. This strategy makes perfect sense if you happen to be bisexual. As the saying goes, write about what you know. The problem is that once you‚Äôre established as a voice on such a narrow topic, how do you remain interesting? How many times can a person write an article about biphobia or bi-erasure before readers and publishers demand something new? The competitive marketplace of ideas incentivizes people to embrace increasingly radical positions. That‚Äôs how a simple idea like ‚Äòsupport same-sex marriage‚Äô [d]evolves into the edgier ‚Äòdismantle the entire concept of marriage because it‚Äôs a heteronormative construct.‚Äô Despite being one of these ‚Äòprofessional bis‚Äô myself, I feel compelled to point out that this race to stay relevant is a dangerous game. It is backfiring on the LGBT community by alienating those who would otherwise be our allies.

‚ÄúI stumbled into ‚Äòbi activism‚Äô accidentally via the LA social scene. My wife, Talia, and I moved from Ashland, Oregon to downtown Los Angeles, where she was pursuing her Masters at USC film school. Neither of us had many friends in the city, so we joined a social club called amBi. At the time, amBi was a local meetup group for bi people in the LA area. Talia knew I was bi, but she identified as straight. Fortunately, the club‚Äôs website made it clear that you don‚Äôt have to be bisexual to join. It clearly stated that ‚Äòpartners and allies‚Äô were welcome. We attended a few events, including a Bi Talent Show at the LA LGBT Center. We quickly made a lot of friends, and our lack-of-an-LA-social-life issue was soon behind us.‚Äù -@rio_veradonir @ambisocial

They unloaded their precious cargo and embarked on a challenging trek through the jungle, following the pastor. Hours passed until they reached their destination, where a gathering of excited local Christians awaited. The joy and gratitude were immeasurable.

Sure, we all know about it but I can guarantee that the CRPD is not top of mind for my sister as she goes about her daily cup of tea, day program, bus trip and set nightly tv viewing schedule.

However, the UN CRPD is there and so far this week I have been struck at how truly foundational it is in our every day lives and in the work of Down Syndrome NSW. 

So too, I have been enthused by the collaborative nature of our government and non government colleagues who have gathered here to advocate, share and learn. 

As I sit here in the General Assembly writing this, I am listening to a plea from the Chair of the UN CRPD Committee that has left me amazed (and infuriated) that many countries are yet to sign up to the UN CRPD.

The opportunity to be representing our loved ones with Down syndrome and intellectual disability and their families is not lost on me. I am proud to give a voice to many who may not have a voice but have so much to say.

With opportunity comes responsibility and it is for this reason that I am writing this commentary to our community. In doing so, my hope is multifaceted ‚Äì to inform, to engage, to have our members feel like they too are here at the UN because they are.

‚ú® Be a voice for representation: Learn about the history of representative bodies and calls for treaty. Listen to the calls, debates and discussions by First Peoples on treaties, constitutional reform, and Voice to Parliament. 

‚ú® Be a voice for unity: Connect with your local Traditional Custodians, amplify their voices and collaborate with local reconciliation groups.

The Voice is a risky, unknown, permanent and divisive change to our Constitution. As a first generation migrant, I value equality of citizenship, yet the fundamental premise of the referendum segregates Australians by race.

Van Badham and Ben Davison are BACK and the struggle continues! Visy, Australia's largest private company, is still refusing to make a decent offer to workers after 20 weeks of action and bosses in the university sector are strategising together to cut pay and conditions while bosses unions are calling for cuts to the minimum wage and the right to keep exploiting sham contracting and labour hire loopholes.

Van and Ben take a look at how sham contracting in the gig economy, labour hire across multiple industries and forced casualisation has undermined wages and conditions.  Ben and Van look at how workers, in union, are campaigning for same job, same pay laws, rights for platform based workers in the NDIS, aged care and transport sectors as well as an end to the loopholes that allow BHP to own a labour hire company it then uses to engage workers in their mines to do the same work but for LESS pay.  

You can stand up for your job and your wages by joining your union at australianunions.org.au/wow 

Ben hits a classic rant about the greedflation spiral, Phil Lowe's high priests of Monetary Policy and why it is time to stop listening to incompetent Australian executives and start believing our own eyes when it comes to economics. 

The Albanese Labor government wants to see more Australian content on Australian screens with proposed laws to make sure streaming services invest here, where they are making their profits.  Van talks about why Aussie stories on Aussie screens is so important.

Plus The Voice is a step closer, despite the misinformation campaigns online.

And good news from one of our staunch supporters about the CSIRO and Hydrogen!

Van shouts out to our Cadre and Extend the Reach supporters who have gone to www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday and signed up to help grow the audience and get every episode delivered to their inbox along with extra content.

Ben admits he couldn't bring himself to watch Insiders as he gives a scathing critique of the Murdoch infiltration of the ABC.  On a week where Stan Grant was hounded out of QandA by Murdoch's dogs, the Uluru statement from the Heart had its anniversary and The Australian admitted to doctoring a letter to the editor about Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson there was an Australian journalist on the Insiders panel.  Who didn't talk about ANY of those issues.

Lidia Thorpe continues to not understand how a referendum works by no claiming she'll abstain from the binary YES or NO vote on the Voice.

Liberals in the senate used their time to continue to platform ideas from Steve Bannon, anti-vaxers, the nuclear lobby and far right ""fathers"" groups while wasting time on the fashion choices of public servants.  In NSW they chose between the loser of Gilmore and the loser of Parramatta to fill a casual senate vacancy.  The loser of Parramatta was chosen.

Meanwhile in the real world more Australian's are trapped in sham contracting and its costing thousands of dollars per worker per year and millions in retirement.  Australian Unions and The Centre for Future Work have research that shows in the NDIS, Aged Care and transport platforms are being used to make people into sham contractors but that it doesn't have to be that way.

I am personally deeply committed to a YES vote, and I feel the weight of responsibility to ensure that everyone in the community is making a very informed choice when they walk into that polling booth in coming months.
 
My belief is that this next step will give a lot of people who have been voiceless to date, excluded from discussion and consultation, a way to actually have their voices listened to.

,,1.95553E+15,1.46072E+14,the voice,Tea Tree Players Theatre,"an ENORMOUS Congratulations to the cast and crew of The Appleton Ladies Potato Race, By Melanie Tait and Directed by Selena Carr - For this simply outstanding review from Stage Whispers - Many thanks to Barry Hill OAM.

Read on to read the review in full:

Tea Tree Players are known for their farces, so this year is an experiment to gauge audience reaction to other forms of theatre. Their first production was a fruity melodrama, now The Appleton Ladies‚Äô Potato Race, a comedy with messages of equality and inclusivity. Later this year they will present the landmark Australian play Cosi, finishing up the year with A Vicar of Dibley Christmas - The Second Coming (plus a Youth Theatre production and a pantomime). The general public are certainly getting more than their money‚Äôs worth!

The play is set in the small (fictional) country town of Appleton in the Southern Highlands of NSW, where the annual show includes carrying large sacks of potatoes round a racetrack. The winner of the men‚Äôs race gets $1000, while the winner of the women‚Äôs race wins a paltry $200. New doctor and returning resident Penny Anderson sees this as completely unfair and sets out to right the wrong.

Playwright Melanie Tait takes real-life events and brings us a warm comedy showing the world that there‚Äôs more than one way to win a race. It is a look at the way country life has been affected by the 21st century and how it responds to the influx of sexual preferences, immigrant influences on food and attitudes and the adaptation of traditional values to modern ideals. Sounds heavy, but it is anything but that.

Director Selena Carr (together with Samuel Creighton) has designed an ingenious set with an open area that serves multiple scenes and side stages that open and close to reveal a hairdressing salon and a doctor‚Äôs surgery. The set is lined with corrugated iron with a scrim across the back that is used for back projection.

Carr wisely focusses on the humanity of the play and brings to life five very believable women who trigger ‚Äòaha‚Äô moments with the audience. Personally, I could see elements of my mother, aunt, and grandmother in these very different personalities.

It is a busy show with many scenes, voice overs, and lighting states. Thanks to props (Beth Venning), lighting and sound (Zack Brittan and Mike Phillips) and a busy stage manager (Tom Moore), the production runs without a hitch.

Sonja Lawrance gives Penny Anderson, the doctor returned to the country to start a medical practice, gravitas, and heart. She is the linchpin of the play and drives the pace and storyline. Her scene with Bev Armstrong is moving.

Heather Riley is tradition personified on the surface, but with the veneer scraped off, she is a vulnerable woman with her own cross to bear. As mentioned above, the doctor‚Äôs office scene is a highlight.

Chris Galipo‚Äôs Barb Ling is a woman with a secret which I will not reveal here. The secret she has been hiding ties up the loose ends of the play nicely. Her monologue with the washing basket in act two is an emotional glimpse into her mind.

Hayley Mitchell plays the ‚Äòloud‚Äô Nikki Armstrong to perfection. It would be easy to caricature this role, Mitchell plays her to the hilt without ever overstepping. Her dance routine at the start of act two is wonderful.

Kahlia Feuerreiter stepped into the role of Rania Hamid ten days before the opening night. Not that you would know. Her accent is perfect. Her balancing act in desiring acceptance, integration and sharing of cultures, whilst also standing up for what she believes in and experiencing both outright and casual racism, is much too familiar with many Australian migrants‚Äô stories and is handled sensitively.

The Appleton Ladies‚Äô Potato Race carries an important message but presents it using humour making it far more palatable. Go and see it. You will be highly entertained and come home with more than a few questions to ponder.

""A key Labor insider on Wednesday called and texted the offices of government MPs strongly advising them not to comment on the issue after The Australian made inquiries.

The advice, which came from the government‚Äôs caucus support unit headed up by Mal Larsen, named in Labor circles as the ‚Äúcaucus whisperer‚Äù, told MPs to ignore the request, even if they were supportive of the move to double dispensing.

The Australian understands some Labor MPs hold concerns over the proposal ‚Äì which will extend the dispensing timeframe from 30 to 60 days from July 1 ‚Äì and have been meeting with Health Minister Mark Butler in recent days to discuss potential impacts on local pharmacies and constituents.""

Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti aka Fela An√≠k√∫l√°p√≥ Kuti was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, musician, singer, composer, bandleader, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. The pioneer of Afrobeat, as well as a voice for the people. Fela, coming from a family of prominent influencers, was destined for greatness. His mother was an anti-colonial feminist that led the Abeokuta Women‚Äôs riots in the 1940s.  His father  was an Anglican minister, as well as the president of the Nigerian Union of Teachers. Fela‚Äôs cousin, Wole Soyinka, is a well-known writer and Nobel Peace Prize winner for literature (the first  Sub-Saharan African to win the award). 

Kuti‚Äôs start in music began in the late 1950s. He was sent abroad to London where he was meant to study medicine, but ended up shifting to study music instead. He mastered many instruments from the trumpet, electric guitar, drums, saxophone, and piano. He put together a band known as Africa 70 (later on renamed Egypt 80) and toured the globe. Kuti was known for extravagant stage performances and powerful societal messaging. Speaking out against the Nigerian military, tyrannical government, and the harsh treatment of the Nigerian people. Fela coined his music style as Afrobeat, a musical fusion highlife, traditional Yoruba music, funk, jazz, and soul. He credits his drummer and musical director Tony Oladipo Allen as being a major player in the creation of Afrobeat. 

Kuti‚Äôs legacy is cemented. He will forever be celebrated and adored for the contributions he made to the African people. For generations to come üá≥üá¨

,,2.03452E+14,1.02891E+14,the voice,Cr Ashleigh Vandenberg - City of Melton - Coburn Ward,"This week has been exceptionally hard, As a Registered Nurse who found her feet on a surgical ward I am used to trauma incidents, but the horrific crash in Eynesbury that has changed the lives of children is different. 

Many residents have raised concerns about the state of our roads, I have raised it and I have even submitted budget submissions for known trouble spots to no avail. While we can turn blame to ‚ÄúDriver behaviour‚Äù 

I am of the belief that when we build roads, Driver behaviour should be part of safety and development. Many of our roads are in my opinion unsafe. 

The truth is, I ran for local government to be a voice for the community. I was a na√Øve nurse who thought I could make a difference. But there is something seriously wrong and dangerous about what is occurring on council. 

Every time I advocate, I am attacked by councillors where it hurts the most, my culture and my identity. My very self. 

It started off being told I and First Nation‚Äôs people‚Äôs want our own country, this is not true. 

It then went onto not believing into Aboriginal Self-Determination, which is everyone‚Äôs human right. 

I was then backed into a corner by fellow councillors told to not make trouble, ridiculed, and asked if I want to leave. 

Then the blackmailing started followed by more stand over tactics and more racist hate towards me and Melton‚Äôs first nation‚Äôs community. Internal comments that First Nation‚Äôs people can go to ‚ÄúSt Albans‚Äù for services. A comment which speaks to me, some councillors do not welcome us here. It is important to note that internal minutes are either barred from being taken or regularly lost to hide such incidents. Unprofessional and dangerous. 

Derogatory comments and statements directed at culturally specific sites. 

I was busy working on a COVID Ward making sure people could get back home to their families and didn‚Äôt have time to educate and it is not my role. I made a complaint about the racism I experienced and sought training for councillors. They were disgusted and my complaint has been deleted and ‚Äúlost‚Äù. 

There is an entire section in FOI documents that speaks to the planning of blackmailing me, some even went to extreme lengths.
I was ambushed in a meeting with Goran the Mayor at the time and Lara Carli the deputy Mayor and presented with a document created by a third councillor where I was denied right of reply, stood over and intimidated. I have raised this complaint and met with the current Mayor Lara and she has blocked and denied my request for action and support. I have made it known I feel unsafe. 

I have been instructed what to say, what to do, have information withheld from me and at times pressured into deleting resident comments and editing messaging, otherwise my work is not supported. I am held hostage as an elected representative. 

In the most recent display of racial vilification on a day that meant so much to me and my family, Sorry day. (City of Melton held our Sorry day early) it is a day to acknowledge the strength of Stolen Generation's Survivors and reflect on how we can all share in the healing process. 

My family, my mother was ripped from my nan‚Äôs arms, barred from her culture, stripped of her identity, and abused on levels much of as could not imagine as a young girl. What she endured was and is Horrific. 

I have on several occasions requested City of Melton to stop doing it to me as my rights are protected, all our rights are.

I met with The Mayor, Lara Carli the evening of the event however, she purposely, willfully and knowingly chose to erase my culture, my identity and continue the perpetration of the stolen generation. 

She did so because she believes she is like me, I am a proud Wiradjuri/Nari Nari woman who has been impacted by the stolen generation. No Lara, you are not me. 

To add insult to injury in this meeting she ridiculed my culture and that of all first nations and made derogatory statements in the presence of our CEO, that her and other Councillors would like ‚Äútitles‚Äù. No Lara, these are not titles, these are our identity, our culture our heritage, much like you use names and surnames. 

It is what you and people like you stole from us, barred us from doing, continue to steal from us and it is what you did to me. It is the most serious crime you could ever commit against a first nation‚Äôs person. 

To add further insult to injury, Cultural competency training is a must, for reasons mentioned above, The Mayor, Lara Carli has continued to complain to our CEO that she wants erase it and create a ‚ÄúALL‚Äù cultures training. 

I have requested that our CEO refer the matter to Victoria Police for action, because racial vilification is a crime and every time I speak up my complaints are blocked, deleted, lost or simply ignored and I am racially targeted and attacked.

National Reconciliation Week runs every year from 27 May to 3 June, with these dates commemorating two significant milestones in the reconciliation journey‚Äî the successful 1967 referendum, and the High Court Mabo decision respectively. 

Reconciliation Week is an important time for all non-Indigenous Australians to learn more about the rich Cultures of First Nations Peoples and acknowledge the true histories of Australia. This year‚Äôs National Reconciliation Week theme ‚ÄòBe a Voice for Generations‚Äô is a chance for non-Indigenous Australians to acknowledge the many achievements of Indigenous Australians within society, and to consider how we can contribute as individuals and as a community to achieving reconciliation.

Just before the week starts, join us on 25 May for our third Monash Speaker Series event: a Voice to Parliament Discussion at The Count‚Äôs, Clayton Campus.

The Greens political party once again is teaming up with the Liberals, Nationals and Pauline Hanson‚Äôs One Nation to block Labor‚Äôs multi-billion-dollar efforts to fix the nation‚Äôs housing crisis.

Labor‚Äôs $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund is the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a decade, but the Greens are stopping it - along with help from the Liberals, Nationals, and Pauline Hanson's One Nation.

Because the Greens refuse to support this legislation, they‚Äôre directly delaying 30,000 new social and affordable homes for Australians in need.

It‚Äôs disgraceful that, while locals are living in cars, and women and children fleeing domestic violence have nowhere to go, local candidate Mandy Nolan and her Greens party colleagues are playing political games.

As the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, I‚Äôm on the ground speaking to locals who desperately need this Bill passed. Our community is appalled that parties in our Parliament, including the Greens, are blocking it.

The Greens have a disgraceful history in teaming up with the Liberals and Nationals‚Äì like blocking the carbon pollution reduction scheme (with Tony Abbott), limiting access to the aged pension (with Malcolm Turnbull), and stopping locals accessing affordable housing (with Peter Dutton).

In contrast, I‚Äôm proud to be your strong voice in the Albanese Labor Government. We had our Prime Minister here on the North Coast again just last week to talk real results - like cheaper childcare, more bulk-billing, and increases in rent assistance.

This is what action looks like and I‚Äôm proud to be your strong voice in the Albanese Labor Government that actually delivers.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=774357537505464

Ben Davison looks at the first 12 months of the Albanese Labor government and some of the big changes ranging from the National Anti-Corruption Commission and Robo-debt royal commission to improvements in job security and wages to NDIS reforms and genuine action on climate change.  The first year of Labor at a national level has achieved a lot.

The union movement has had successes on wages, women's participation in the workforce, job security, the energy transition authority and improvements to the social wage.  join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Ben also takes a look at why media is obsessed with the negatives.  The Voice is a classic example where two polls released in the same week get very different treatment by the media.  Ben explains how this empowers the fringe elements and the impact that has on people, such as Stan Grant's announcement, and our political system.

The Liberal's in Victoria continue to want a party leader that will embrace hatred and defend Nazism with the state conference in Bendigo marred by walkouts, booing and cries of ""shame"" as Menzian Liberal leader John Pesutto took the stage.

Ben asks the question, if we want more progress on #education, #healthcare, #NDIS, tax reform and #climate change do we really think the Liberals will deliver it better than Labor?

,,7.9292E+14,1.01475E+14,the voice,M De Klerk,"Jesus' message to the churches today!

What is the meaning of the 7 churches in the Book of Revelation?

Today I am going to discuss our period only, the Church of Laodicea... We are indeed in big, big trouble‚ö†Ô∏è

üîò Each church is promised that everyone who conquers will be rewarded by Christ... Sadly the mainstream Churches today believe the church is a democracy and what the majority of their attendees want they can get. They only need to vote. This is a lie from satan himself. God is not a Democracy. His Laws and Commandments can not be voted away, they can only be obeyed. 

üîò The 7 churches is representing 7 different periods in the history of the Western Church from the time of Paul until the return of Jesus Christ.

üîò Laodicea is our period and has the unfortunate distinction of being the only church that receives no positive commentary, whatsoever. God is not happy with the state the churches are in today...

üîò Laodicea ( WE) is charged with being spiritually inert: lukewarm, rather than either hot or cold. This evokes the disgusting sensation of room-temperature water in one's mouth. 

üîòJesus heavily criticized this church ( US) for being arrogant and apathetic. Rather than being spiritually passionate, they are passive. Instead of being cold, meaning they are more likely to respond to the gospel, they are just familiar enough with God to brush Him off. Jesus still offers a chance for repentance‚Äîbut He describes Himself as ""outside"", knocking at the door and expecting them to answer (Revelation 3:14‚Äì22).

üîò Sadly we can see in Revelations 3:14-22 that Jesus is not inside the mainstream Church. He is outside knocking. This means none of these churches belongs to him or does His will... 

üîò The message is from the Lord Jesus Christ via an angel or messenger (likely a reference to the church‚Äôs pastor): ‚ÄúTo the angel of the church in Laodicea write . . .‚Äù (Revelation 3:14). This was not simply John‚Äôs message to those in Laodicea or us; it was a message from the Lord HIMSELF. Jesus identifies Himself thus: ‚ÄúThe Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God‚Äôs creation.‚Äù These titles emphasize the Lord‚Äôs faithfulness, sovereignty, and power to bring all things to their proper completion (the ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù).

üîò In contrast to the other 6 churches, the Laodicean church has nothing to commend it. Jesus begins the message with condemnation: 

üò•‚ÄúI know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm‚Äîneither hot nor cold‚ÄîI am about to spit you out of my mouth. 

üò™You say, ‚ÄòI am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.‚Äô But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked‚Äù (Revelation 3:15-17). 

üîò Jesus emphasizes their  (our) ‚Äúlukewarm,‚Äù apathetic nature three times. As a result of their ambivalence to spiritual things, Jesus would have nothing to do with them. He would ‚Äúspit them out,‚Äù as the people of Laodicea would spit out the tepid water that flowed from the underground aqueducts to their city. With their apathy came spiritual blindness; they claimed to be rich, blessed, and self-sufficient. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Perhaps they were rich in material things. But, spiritually, the Laodiceans (US) were in a wretched, pitiful condition, made all the worse in that they could not see their need. 

‚ö†Ô∏èThis (WE) are a church filled with self-deceived hypocrites.

üîòJesus calls the Laodicean church ( US) to repent of its sin: ‚ÄúI counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see‚Äù (Revelation 3:18). Their material wealth had no eternal benefit, so Jesus commands them to come to Him for true, spiritual riches (see Isaiah 55:1-2). Only Christ can supply an everlasting inheritance, clothe us in righteousness, and heal our spiritual blindness.

üîòJesus then notes His concern for His church in Laodicea: ‚ÄúThose whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent. Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me‚Äù (Revelation 3:19-20). His rebuke is not born of animosity but of love. ‚ÄúThe Lord disciplines those he loves‚Äù (Hebrews 12:6). The desired response to God‚Äôs reproof was zealous change and true repentance.

üîòVerse 20 is often used as an evangelistic appeal, yet its original context communicates Christ‚Äôs desire for fellowship with His lukewarm church in Laodicea (US). The church is nominally Christian, 

‚ö†Ô∏èbut Christ Himself has been locked out. He is not part of them(us)

üîòRather than turn His back on them (us), He knocks, seeking someone to acknowledge the church‚Äôs need and open the door. If they would repent, Jesus would come in and take His rightful place in the church. He would share a meal with them, a Middle Eastern word picture speaking of the closeness of the relationship.

üíúJesus then makes a promise to the believers in Laodicea: ‚ÄúTo him who overcomes, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne‚Äù (Revelation 3:21). The ‚Äúovercomer‚Äù refers to any believer, and the promise is that he will share Christ‚Äôs future kingdom.

üîòIn summaryüëá

 The mainstream churches today had become apathetic in their love for Christ. They ( We) were allowing ‚Äúthe deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things üëâ (openly sins and disobeying clear important commandments from God by voting them out as unessential or traditional nonsense) [to] come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful‚Äù (Mark 4:19). There is no difference between Christians and worldly people today, we and they acting and looking the same......Christ called them (US) to repent and live zealously for Him, to ‚Äúchoose for yourselves this day whom you will serve‚Äù (Joshua 24:15). The Lord Jesus issues the same call to those who say they follow Him today.

Kind regards in Christ üíú",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=792919742392852

The attacks driven by hardcore yes advocates are leading the charge especially with awful attacks against Peter Dutton. 

Everyone in the Federal Liberal Party supports Indigenous recognition but in the referendum question Labor has not separated recognition and establishing their Voice body ‚Äì which is adding another layer of government which every piece of legislation would first need to go through.  

Albanese must negotiate, not dictate to Australian people. 

Just in the last budget Labor ripped $50M away for the Safer Communities Program which I developed to support high risk youth, especially Aboriginal youth.

,,7.2115E+14,1.69365E+15,the voice,CPP,"Friends, we must come together to address a heart-wrenching issue that continues to haunt our nation: child abuse. Our children deserve a safe and nurturing environment where they can grow, thrive, and fulfil their potential. Yet, the reality is stark and alarming. It's time to break the silence and take a stand against child abuse in Australia!

üõë What can we do? Here are some crucial steps we need to take:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Raise Awareness: Share this post and spread the word to ensure that no one remains uninformed. Knowledge is the first step towards action!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Educate Yourself: Learn to recognize the signs of child abuse and neglect. By understanding the indicators, we can intervene and protect vulnerable children in our communities.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Report Suspected Abuse: If you witness or suspect child abuse, it is our responsibility to report it immediately to the appropriate authorities. Let's prioritize the safety and well-being of our children above all else.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Support Organisations: Contribute your time, resources, or funds to local organizations working tirelessly to prevent child abuse and support survivors. Together, we can make a difference!

5Ô∏è‚É£ Be a Supportive Listener: Encourage open conversations about child abuse. By lending a compassionate ear, we can help survivors heal and foster a safe space for them to share their experiences.

üíô Remember, every child deserves to be loved, protected, and given a chance to thrive. It's time to break the cycle of abuse and create a safer future for generations to come.

Let us stand united against child abuse in Australia! Share, spread the message, and let your voice be heard. Together, we can build a brighter and safer tomorrow for our children. üí™üåü

The most important thing you can do after sending in your own submission is to encourage other people and organisations to do the same.

Submissions play a critical role in the Committee recommending a permanent ban of waterbird shooting, and the Government then following this recommendation and legislating the ban in Parliament.

It is critical to not only increase the number of submissions supporting a ban, but to ensure submissions address a wide variety of issues including:

‚Ä¢Community values and perspective;
‚Ä¢Cultural, social and recreational aspects;
‚Ä¢Sustainability, environmental and animal welfare aspects of native bird hunting;
‚Ä¢Economic considerations;
‚Ä¢Perspectives of First Nations;
‚Ä¢How native bird hunting is managed in other jurisdictions; and
‚Ä¢Any other issue relevant to duck shooting

Do you know people or organisations who feel passionately that this barbaric sport should end? Or are impacted by duck shooting each year in relation to the issues above? 

If we all commit to asking 5 people and 2 organisations, even if just a few of the people you ask write submissions, think of how many more submissions supporting a ban they will receive. 

By working together we can finally secure a permanent ban to this immense suffering.  
.
.
.
Any individual or organisation wishing to make a written submission to the Committee, or register an interest in presenting oral evidence to the Committee, is invited to do so by Friday, 19 May 2023. 

Written submissions and expressions of interest should be addressed to the Secretary to the Committee, C/- Parliament House, GPO Box 572, Adelaide 5001, or emailed to scnativebirds@parliament.sa.gov.au

Van Badham and Ben Davison take a deep dive on the ideological frameworks that have crafted the first Commonwealth budget surplus in 15 years while also delivering increases to wages, Jobseeker, parenting payments, rent assistance and massive investments in health, Medicare and aged care.

The budget doesn't deliver everything everyone wants and Ben and Van explain how and why some of the decisions, both popular and unpopular, have their roots in Keynesian economics which, after 40 years of neoliberalism, is not something everyone instantly recognises.

Australian Unions has had some big wins in this budget for jobs, wages, energy transition, TAFE and much more.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

There is also great news for the environment with the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency and big investments in our national parks and waterways.  

Plus real commitments to the arts, the Voice, breaking the artificial ""caps"" imposed under Morrisonism and beginning to rebuild our public services, needs based education and NDIS.

In line with the State Government‚Äôs election commitment, on 9 March 2023 the Legislative Council formed a Committee to inquire into the hunting of native waterbirds.  

The Committee is now calling for submissions. 

Submissions play a critical role in the Committee recommending a permanent ban of waterbird shooting, and the Government then following this recommendation and legislating the ban in Parliament.

The Committee will consider a range of issues related to the shooting of waterbirds, with particular reference to: 

‚Ä¢Community values and perspective;
‚Ä¢Cultural, social and recreational aspects;
‚Ä¢Sustainability, environmental and animal welfare aspects of native bird hunting;
‚Ä¢Economic considerations;
‚Ä¢Perspectives of First Nations;
‚Ä¢How native bird hunting is managed in other jurisdictions; and
‚Ä¢Any other relevant matter

Any individual or organisation wishing to make a written submission to the Committee, or register an interest in presenting oral evidence to the Committee, is invited to do so by Friday, 19 May 2023. 

Written submissions and expressions of interest should be addressed to the Secretary to the Committee, C/- Parliament House, GPO Box 572, Adelaide 5001, or emailed to scnativebirds@parliament.sa.gov.au

Please note that it is extremely important to write submissions that are unique and personal - if the Committee feels that the same submission has been submitted multiple times, it will be treated like a petition and will significantly reduce the impact of your submission. 

Please also note the importance of addressing a wide variety of issues that relate to waterbird shooting. The suffering inflicted on waterbirds is of course a significant issue, but the greater the diversity of issues raised, addressed, demonstrated and supported by evidence, the more likely the committee will see no other option but to vote for a permanent ban of waterbird shooting. Addressing even just one of these issues will be extremely helpful, there is no need to address all of them unless you want to.

They had been found wandering the streets near their home, hardly clothed, Kai in just a dirty nappy. They were taken to hospital where Taylor was treated for ringworm and a bad lung infection, and both were found to be seriously malnourished. We suspect that Taylor has also experienced significant developmental delays.

Thanks to the kindness of Barnardos supporters, Taylor and Kai are now safe and living with one of our amazing foster carers. 
But they have a very long road ahead, if they are to recover from their traumatic early start and go on to live their brightest future.

What is happening?
How can we help?

Political conflicts often arise for unknown reasons around the world, and civilians bear the brunt of the consequences. Sudan, a country already struggling with poor economic and humanitarian conditions, is currently experiencing violent clashes between the official army and an armed militia. The conflict has disproportionately affected people with disabilities and special needs, who have long faced difficulty integrating into society and accessing adequate care resources.

During the clashes‚Äô, disabled individuals were unable to evacuate from conflict zones and were killed alongside hundreds of others. Additionally, over 250,000 people, including many with special needs, were forced to flee to neighbouring countries. Infinite Support, a humanitarian organization with expertise in caring for people with disabilities, believes that it is their duty to support and aid those with disabilities and special needs among the Sudanese population.

We, at Infinite Support, are always ready to liaise with organisations, whether through ideas or implementation of any support we can provide. We have staff who are already donating belongings and necessities, our marketing team are arranging partnerships with local organisations to provide financial aid. 

If you would like to contribute in any way, please contact us on
admin@infinite.support.com.au or 0414 922 768.

We believe that we are very lucky with the many experiences, over the long years of work with all types of disabilities and special needs which is now allowing for us to advocate and support those whos‚Äô voice are not being heard.

The Mayor said that ""Children are never too young to receive such messages"" she was referring to books which cover queer theory, trans ideology and gender identity. 

Some of the books include:

1. Jacob‚Äôs School Play Starring He, She, and They which - ‚Äúintroduces readers to gender identity and pronoun use‚Äù

2. She‚Äôs my dad - ‚Äúan illustrated picture book that tells the story of Mini and her dad Haley, a transgender woman‚Äù 

3. The hips on the Drag go swish swish swish - ‚Äúa quirky twist on a classic nursery rhyme by illustrating all of the ways to ""work it"". The story plays off ""The Wheels on the Bus"" as it follows a drag queen who performs her routine in front of an awestruck audience.‚Äù   

4. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo - ‚Äúexplores issues of same sex marriage‚Äù

5. Bunny Bear - ‚ÄúAlthough Bunnybear was born a bear, he feels more like a bunny‚Ä¶.The other bears don't understand him, and neither do the bunnies.‚Äù

These books will only confuse children and the Mayor is sticking by her decision to push these ideologies onto kids. The Mayor and the councillors are not backing down. They‚Äôre determined for children to be exposed to this content. They‚Äôll hide behind buzz words like inclusivity and inclusion but really it‚Äôs indoctrination and confusion. 

The Mayors contact details are below. Get in touch with her and voice your concerns. Because I for one am sick of people facilitating the indoctrination of children into these ideologies and sexualising kids when they‚Äôre much too young to receive such messages. Remember this is for kids aged 1 to 6. 

We as a society must do more to protect the innocence of children. Let kids be kids. Do what you want when you‚Äôre an adult. But children are off limits. 

If you‚Äôre sick of this too then you need to do something about it. Otherwise it will not stop and it will only get worse.

,,1.43753E+15,1.13094E+14,the voice,Dreame C,"Becca. 
Tally's house was a dream home‚Äîliterally. Her father had built it from a dream he'd had, or so he'd told us when we were young girls. Looking at it now, I believed it. Little did I know that, in this house, all of my dreams would start to come true.

Five years had gone by since the last time I came to Miami. Pulling up to Tally's house felt just like it had been so many times before. I had spent so many summers in this home, coming here was like greeting an old friend. 

The mansion had tall, white, towering columns lining the porch, accenting the huge archways over the doors. The architecture was unique to Tally's father's taste, which made sense since he had dreamed it up. 

The difference now was the roof had been redone in Mediterranean terracotta shingles, and the landscaping was completely different, now with an Italian flare. Mr. Valentino had even added a white marble fountain to the front yard that featured a goddess being worshiped. He had really outdone himself and based on the looks of the outside, I couldn't wait to see what he had changed inside. This was my home away from home. 

‚ÄúOh, my god!"""" Tally screamed excitedly. ‚ÄúLook at this place! Dad really did a number on the renovations, didn't he, Becca?""""

‚ÄúYeah, totally awesome,"""" I replied, glancing towards Tally, shaking my head.

Thank god she has never been to my parents' house. As much as I didn't want to think Tally would judge the way I grew up‚Äîshe would. Prim and proper was Tally's norm. These sorts of luxuries weren't possible for someone like me.

I didn't come from mansions or luxury cars or tight security. My family didn't have yachts and butlers and maids. All of which seemed to tend to any need Tally could possibly ever have. But it didn't matter to me in the end. I loved the life I lived, and I was grateful to have been able to take part in Tally's as well.

How we had become friends I would never understand, but I was grateful to have her. We had been there for each other through a lot, and no matter how much we could irritate each other, we were like sisters.

‚ÄúI'm starving. I wonder if Dad has a small spread ready for our arrival,"""" she murmured as she grabbed her stuff and glanced at me. ‚ÄúReady to get this party started?""""

‚ÄúSure."""" Shaking my head with a smile, I watched her move with excitement towards the front door. Its mahogany finish gleamed in the Miami sun. Beautiful. That's what it was.

Passing the threshold, it was as if being instantly transported to Italy. The decor embellished every inch of the Tuscan Valley, highlighting every aspect of the magical home. The last time I had come here was when Tally's parents got divorced. At that point in time, the home was still wildly styled to Tally's mother's taste. So seeing her father's preference brought to life was a refreshing sight. 
‚ÄúDaddy!"""" Tally screamed, dropping all of her bags to the floor haphazardly as she moved towards the kitchen. ‚ÄúI'm home!""""

I wasn't sure why Tally continued to act like she was five, but at the same time, I was too entranced with the decor to care. Carefully, I sat done my things next to Tally's while my eyes stared at the ceiling as I spun slowly in a circle, taking it all in.

‚ÄúMaybe he isn't here,"""" I said as my eyes met hers once more. 
‚ÄúHe is here. His car was in the drive, and he told me he had a long meeting. That's why he didn't meet us at the airport.""""

Rolling my eyes, my face must express a smirk as I took a seat on one of the tall vintage barstools. There was only so much Tally-drama I could deal with, and considering we hadn't even been here ten minutes, I would say this was a new record. Regardless, though, I didn't want to partake in the conversation she was about to have with him. I already knew where it would go. 

‚ÄúWell,"""" I shrugged, ‚Äúmaybe he took another car?"""" 

It's not like he is short on the money to afford it.

‚ÄúThis is not right!"""" Tally screamed out in frustration. ‚ÄúHe was supposed to greet me as soon as I got home.""""

Ah. There she is! Princess Tally at her finest. As my eyes cast towards the window in the kitchen, I caught sight of the Adonis-like figure swimming laps in the pool. There was no doubt in my mind who it was....Because I already knew. James Valentino. Tally's father.

Since I was sixteen years old, I had thought about him. I knew it was wrong, but at the same time, it was a childish fantasy. One I never dared to share with Tally. Not to mention her father would never dare take advantage of a young girl. 

‚ÄúUh, it looks like he is getting out of the pool,"""" I breathed out, trying to divert my attention.
No matter how many times I tried to take my eyes off of him, I couldn't. He was far too breathtaking. Oh dear God. Is he getting more attractive the older he gets?

‚ÄúWhat?"""" She gasped as she glanced in the direction I was looking. ‚ÄúSwimming instead of meeting me when I walked through the door?""""

The disdain in her voice snapped me out of my trance and caused me to roll my eyes.

‚ÄúI don't understand what the big deal is, Tally. Who cares? We are here now, and we have an entire summer to enjoy.""""

She spun to face me; her gaze spoke volumes about her unhappiness. ‚ÄúI know this.""""
‚ÄúSooo?"""" I shrugged. ‚ÄúThen what's the big deal?""""

Crossing her arms, she scoffed, ‚ÄúBecause Daddy always greets me at the door. You don't think he has a new woman, do you?""""
Laughter escapes me as I stare at her in disbelief. ‚ÄúSeriously? That's your go-to?""""
‚ÄúWell‚Äî"""" she shrugged in frustration, ‚ÄúI read online that when men change their patterns, it's usually because of a big change... like a new woman.""""

Should have seen that. It's what happened with Chad, I silently noted with a sigh. I couldn't understand her reasoning. ‚ÄúWould that honestly be a bad thing?""""
‚ÄúYes!"""" she shrieked. ‚ÄúOh, my god, Becca. That would be like the worst thing ever. If he wants a woman, he can get back with my mom.""""

Just as she said the words, the sliding glass door opened, and the most attractive man I had ever laid my eyes on stepped through the doorway. The Italian Stallion has arrived. God, he is so charming.

The unbelievable remark running through my mind caused me to hold myself as my eyes could not stop staring at him. No matter how much time passed, I still had the imagination to be around him into the new year.  I would do anything to make him happy. I don‚Äôt mind, I'm not picky.

‚ÄúWhere were you?"""" Tally snapped with disapproval, pulling me from my delicious thoughts. ‚ÄúI expected to see you, and you weren't there. I don't understand.""""

Confusion passed through his eyes as he stared at her with shock. ‚ÄúSweetie, I didn't think your flight was supposed to be here for another hour.""""

‚ÄúUh‚Äìno,"""" she quipped. ‚ÄúI sent you my flight info, and I texted you.""""
‚ÄúYou did?"""" he replied, picking his phone off the bar and quickly scrolling through it.
Standing impatiently, she stared at him. ‚ÄúYeah, I did.""""
‚ÄúI'm sorry, sweetie,"""" he shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess it slipped my mind. I'll make it up to you.""""
Smart man. Smart man.

When it came to Tally, we both knew how to act. Because if Tally didn't get her way, you would think World War III was breaking out due to her disregard and meltdowns.

‚ÄúIt's okay,"""" she sighed. ‚ÄúBecca and I are hungry and tired. Can we order food?""""
As his eyes slowly slid to me, he furrowed his brow in confusion, ‚ÄúBecca?""""

Of course, he doesn't recognize me. ‚ÄúHey,"""" I smiled, trying not to look down.

This man was really difficult to ignore, and with my nonexistent romance for the past few weeks, I was completely distracted. Come on now, Becca. Stop thinking weird about your friend's dad. What on earth are you thinking!

‚ÄúYou have grown up a lot, Becca,"""" Mr. Valentino replied, his dark, sultry gaze scanning up and down me. 

Oh gosh. Was he checking me out?!

‚ÄúYeah."""" The breathlessness of my response caused me to clear my throat as I quickly averted my gaze, trying to look anywhere but at him. I wasn't trying to be rude, but if this conversation didn't end quickly, I was going to give away my unrealistic thoughts by looking at his charming look.

‚ÄúSo..."""" he muttered, looking between the two of us. ‚ÄúWhat are the plans for summer?""""
Before I could even get a word in, Tally started rambling off about the parties and boating trips she wanted to take. Even though I was her guest, he was already accustomed to the fact we often did things apart.

‚ÄúAnd you, Becca?"""" he asked, bringing me back to the present. ‚ÄúAnything you would like to do?""""
Yeah, dreaming about you.

‚ÄúUm. I'm not quite sure yet. Had some rough stuff happen a few weeks back, so kind of looking to relax and enjoy my summer? Then, it's back to school for my last year."""" I smiled, nodding my head as a glint of amusement crossed his eyes.

‚ÄúOh, very nice,"""" he said, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúWhat was your degree again?""""

‚ÄúStatistics and Data Science,"""" I replied as I gazed down at my fidgeting hands.

‚ÄúShe's a math nerd, Dad. You give her anything to do with numbers, and she is quick with a response. Bookkeeping and calculations and all that stuff. Kind of like you.""""

Tally's response caused me to laugh before I cleared my throat, realizing I was finding amusement in her calling her dad a math nerd, basically. 

‚ÄúSomething like that,"""" his reply was followed by making a little expression on his face as my gaze met his once more. I didn't understand what was going through his head at that moment, but I was intrigued to find out.

Pulling out her phone, I watched as Tally replied to whatever text she got while smacking on the bright pink bubble gum she had consumed at some point. ‚ÄúOh dear. Becca, we need to get unpacked. Jesse wants us to meet for food.""""

‚ÄúOh‚Äìokay,"""" I said, not really looking forward to it. ‚ÄúI thought we were going to eat here.""""
‚ÄúI can order food,"""" Mr. Valentino said happily as he glanced between Tally and I. 
‚ÄúNo, no,"""" Tally scoffed. ‚ÄúWe are just going to go out.""""

I felt bad about the situation overall. Mr. Valentino didn't know we were going to be here so soon, and Tally was acting childish. Even if I loved her dearly, the way she was acting was unacceptable.

‚ÄúOkay then,"""" he smiled. ‚ÄúIt's really nice to have you home, sweetie. I hope we can spend some time together while you're here.""""

The notion warmed my heart and made me miss my own father. But in true Tally fashion, she didn't hold the same sweet sentiment I did.

‚ÄúI'll fit something in,"""" she replied as she made her way towards the stairs. ‚ÄúCan Rosa bring our things upstairs, please? I need to unpack and take a shower.""""

As Tally disappeared from sight, I shook my head, jumping off the barstool.
‚ÄúThanks for letting me stay for the summer, Mr. Valentino. I appreciate it.""""

His eyes drifted from where his daughter had disappeared to me, and as he looked at me, I couldn't help but feel small under his gaze. ‚ÄúThere is no need to thank me, Becca. Also, will you please call me James?""""

First name basis? Oh, gosh‚Ä¶ Becca, stop, you're reading too much into it.
‚ÄúIf that's what you would like‚Ä¶ James,"""" I replied softly, fluttering my eyelashes. ‚ÄúI better get going. I guess I'll see you around.""""

Raising a brow, his smile never faltered as he nodded, ‚ÄúOh, you definitely will.""""
Going out with Tally had been more of a headache than I wanted it to be. What started out with dinner turned into an all-nighter at a local club. The stench of stale stuff littered my clothing from earlier in the night, as well as, the few droplets of puke Tally had managed to get on me when I was near her.
It shouldn't have been much of a surprise how the evening turned out. Yet, once again, I was left to babysit her while she dabbled in the fun. 

I wasn't the party girl Tally had become, and even though she knew that, she still tried to drag me around. Sometimes I wondered if that was simply a way to make sure she had a designated driver or if she genuinely enjoyed my company.

By the time we had arrived back at her home, the lights were off, and it was dark. Tally was unable to carry herself up the stairs, which meant that it had been my job to do so.
Lucky me!

After I had helped Tally with her dress and put her in bed, and a hot shower had washed away the remainder of the night from myself, I lay on my bed, trying to find the will to go to sleep. Too much had happened over the past few weeks. My mind still reeled from my breakup with Chad, but I also couldn't stop thinking about James.

James was different. Not only was he incredibly attractive, with his perfect look I wanted to be around him for days, but he was old school. He seemed like the kind of man who knew how to wine and dine a girl. Treat her special, and never cheat on her with some mystery girl like Chad did to me. 

I didn't know James that way, but my mind constantly wondered. I wondered how he would treat me and about all the wonderful things he could do to me. I didn't understand the rush of emotions he brought over me. I wasn't the bad girl type, and yet everything about him wanted to make me just be around him.

I'm an unreasonable person to think a man like James Valentino would be interested in me though. Allison, Tally's mom, is beautiful and classy. She has taste and is sophisticated‚Ä¶ I can never be her.
Tally had plenty of male friends in this city, and even though I didn't want another relationship, I couldn't help but wonder if one of them would want to be with me. 
Picking up my phone, I scrolled through social media and took in the various photos of Chad and I that were posted on my account. I hadn't had the courage to get rid of them yet, and looking back at it now, I felt even more pathetic.

With a push of a few buttons and much-needed courage, I deleted the history of my relationship with Chad. I welcomed the hollow feeling when I was finished, but at the same time, it hurt.
‚ÄúGod, why can't I sleep,"""" I groaned as I looked at the clock, realizing I had spent two hours lying awake instead of sleeping.

Slipping from bed, I padded my way out of my room and towards the stairs. The idea of hot tea and a snack to settle my mind seemed more enjoyable with every step I took.

Through the darkness, I made my way to the kitchen. The dim light over the stove was enough for me to see what I was doing, and yet, not disturb anyone in the home. Not that anyone would likely wake. It was 3:00 in the morning, and normal people slept at this hour. 

As I moved around the kitchen setting the kettle, I hummed a tune from earlier in the night that had gotten stuck in my head. 

‚ÄúHaving fun?"""" a voice called from behind me, causing a small scream to leave my throat as I spun around, coming face to face with James himself. His dark, brooding eyes stared at me with amusement.

As much as I wanted to form a coherent sentence at that moment, my thoughts were lost in the realization that James, my best friend's father, was standing before me. 
Oh, sweet baby Jesus. ‚ÄúUh-oh, hey. Sorry, just making tea.""""

‚ÄúI see that,"""" he hummed with amusement. ‚ÄúCouldn't sleep either?""""
Shaking my head, I shrugged my shoulders. ‚ÄúNot lately. Plus, after all the excitement tonight, I had to wind down.""""

There was a moment of awkward silence that fell between us as James stood by the counter, simply staring at me. Clearing my throat, I turned back towards the kettle that was now hissing and poured the hot water over the tea bag so it could steep. Motion out of the corner of my eye made me freeze as I realized he had taken two steps towards me.

‚ÄúYou really have changed over the years‚Ä¶ haven't you, Becca?"""" he whispered softly, causing me to turn around and notice only a few feet between us.

My heart raced with anticipation of what was happening. Was this what I hoped it was? But I couldn't do that to Tally, could I?

‚ÄúYeah,"""" I replied uncomfortably, ‚ÄúI guess I have. I'm not really the dorky girl I was the last time I was here. Then again, I could say you have changed as well.""""

He had changed. He had gotten older, obviously, but he didn't seem as sad as he once had. Instead, he seemed satisfied with his life. As if he finally found his calling after leaving his ex-wife, Allison.

‚ÄúInteresting."""" His eyes took me in once more as he casually leaned against the counter. ‚ÄúSo, did your boyfriend decide to join you this summer as well?""""

My eyes kept drifting down on him. His figure was hard to ignore. I tried not to look, but I couldn't help it when he stood so willingly in front of me.

‚ÄúUh, no."""" I shrugged, trying to remain calm. ‚ÄúI don't have one. We broke up a few weeks ago.""""
Intrigue seemed to get to him as I responded. As if that had been the answer he was hoping for. 

‚ÄúIs that right? Was it mutual then?"""" 

Glancing down, I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo, not exactly.""""

No matter how innocent his question had been, the wound of Chad's betrayal was still fresh. So for James to bring it up was like pouring salt on an open wound.

‚ÄúI'm sorry if I upset you, Becca. That wasn't my intention.""""

‚ÄúNo, no. You're fine,"""" I replied as my eyes met his again. ‚ÄúJust, bad things happened, and it wasn't the most joyous moment in my life. Nothing I won't get over with in time, though.""""

There was an unmistakable fire that crossed his gaze for a moment at my words. I wasn't sure what it was, but it was almost as if he was angry, but pleased at the same time.

‚ÄúHe was not smart enough for letting a beautiful woman like you go."""" 

Oh gosh, he just called me beautiful. The compliment caused my cheeks to redden with embarrassment as I tried to hold myself and quickly turned back to my tea.

I wasn't sure why his remark surprised me like it did. Men from his generation were notorious for being this way, or at least, that was the assumption I had with most men I knew his age. My professors and even my dad's friends were from a generation of class. So why was it that his words caused me to react like this? Trying to wrap my head around what he was saying, I cleared my throat and straightened my shoulders. 

‚ÄúThank you for your compliment. But I am not as pretty as other women. Plus, I am driven when it comes to my career. So I wasn't giving him the attention he wanted.""""

Excuses. They were all excuses, but at the same time, these excuses were what allowed me to get past the pain I felt over Chad's betrayal. The excuses I made were ones I gave for his actions towards me. No matter how horrible they were.

‚ÄúHe didn't deserve you. Traits like that I think are attractive in a woman,"""" James replied moving next to me, causing my breath to catch in my throat. I was highly aware of the distance between us in the kitchen. The fact that we were being alone made me excited, and I hoped he couldn't tell how much I felt. 

Slowly turning around, I faced him. In the time I hadn't been paying attention, he had got himself there near me, and the distance between us caused my heart to race.

I wasn't trying to be bad, but the smell of him wrapping around me made me want to do all kinds of bad things. ‚ÄúPerhaps, someday, someone will show me what it is I deserve."""" 

My words came off more suggestive than I'd meant them to be, and he must have noticed, because his response was to look at me gently as he moved toward me. Being near him did not help me with my imagination to be just with him. I wanted it so bad to happen, but at the same time, there was no way a man like James Valentino wanted me. Not to mention, you ungrateful girl, that is your best friend's dad.

As he pulled back, setting his cup on the counter, I tried to clear my mind. There was a boundary I didn't need to cross, and with the teasing moments around us, I was dangerously close to crossing.

‚ÄúAre you okay?"""" he whispered, causing me to slowly look up at him to see the amusement dancing within his eyes.

‚ÄúOf course, why wouldn't I be?"""" I shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúAre you?""""

As his eyes drifted down, I felt the stir within me once more.

‚ÄúOh, I'm more than alright, Becca."""" He grinned and his eyes met mine again. It took me a moment to process what he meant, and as I glanced down, I saw my little reaction. 

‚ÄúOh, I'm so sorry,"""" I stammered, wrapping my arms. ‚ÄúIt's a bit cold.""""

‚ÄúNo, it isn't."""" He chuckled as he grabbed his glass and went to the fridge to pour a drink.  He may have been right, but the arrogant response made me surprise.

‚ÄúYes, it is. It's a bit chilly, and well, yeah‚Äî"""" 
As the door to the fridge closed, he turned to face me, sipping from his cup. The movement of his Adam's apple as he drank down the liquid caught my eye. I had never seen something as simple as that look so attractive before.

‚ÄúI know what you want, Becca,"""" he said, grasping my attention once more.

‚ÄúI don't want anything,"""" I replied, trying to play the moment off.

‚ÄúEnough."""" Setting his cup down, he quickly cleared the space between us once more. 

‚ÄúMr. Valentino‚Äî""""

‚ÄúI told you to call me James, Becca."""" His firm reply flipped the switch on the situation and instantly made me want to behave. ‚ÄúI can see that you get excited, but I can promise you I'm not what you want. The things I would do‚Ä¶ well, they would be too much for you.""""

Oh gees. ‚ÄúY-you have no idea what I can handle. You don't know me like that.""""

My stuttered response showed clearly how uneasy I was with this situation, and yet I wanted it. 

‚ÄúBe a good girl, Becca. You need to go upstairs and go to bed,"""" he whispered as he inhaled deeply and pushed himself back from where we stood. 

The distance he was placing between us gave me a chance to breathe once more. Without a moment of hesitation, my feet pushed me towards the stairs, only he stopped me again. 

‚ÄúRemember what I said,"""" he all but growled in an amazing way that had frozen me. 
Turning to face him, I tried to push him away. But the realization hit me that he was within my reach made everything worse. Snapping out of my daydream, I quickly freed myself from his grasp. He was there and he stared at me, making everything harder. 

‚ÄúGoodnight, Mr. Valentino,"""" I stuttered, forcing my gaze from his before I turned and fled from the kitchen, quickly running up the stairs.

James Valentino was a mysterious man, and there was no telling what he truly meant by what he'd said. Perhaps he was dangerous, but perhaps I would like it.
James.

‚ÄúDaniel, as you can see, there are numerous ways we can better help you profit from your industry if you use our company. Our importing and exporting section far surpasses that of our competitors.""""
I watched as the CEO of Citadel Furnishing thought about my proposal. I had spent months trying to close this deal, and with weeks of back and forth, I knew without a doubt I had this in the bag. A smile lined the man's face as he nodded. ‚ÄúLet's do it,"""" he replied, holding out his hand, which I quickly shook. 

‚ÄúI look forward to our future business together. If you wait just a moment, I will have Evette bring in the paperwork for you to sign, and then we will have someone take you on a tour of the docks so you can see our company at its finest.""""

Evette brought in the paperwork, Daniel signed it, and then I sent him off for the promised tour. Once he was gone, I reached for my phone which had gone off a few different times during my meeting. 

Tally. 

The girl was difficult, but as my only child, I loved her no matter what she did. She was the princess in my kingdom, and I was the king of my castle. For years I had tried to correct Tally's behavior, but her mother was always an obstacle.

'Having people over today for a pool party.'
Shaking my head, I sighed. There was no arguing with this girl.
'That's fine. I will be home later this afternoon. Do you girls need anything?'
A few moments passed, and I watched the small bubbles at the bottom of our chat move. 
'We're fine. See.'
A photo pushed through on my screen, and I smiled at my beautiful daughter, Tally, dressed with a straw hat and cover-up over her bathing suit. She was beautiful, just like her mother.
'You look beautiful, sweetie. Be safe, see you soon. Xx'
As soon as I sent the text, though, another photo came through, and it was one that made me internally groan. My hand was tightening on the phone as I stared down at the smiling face. It was of Becca. My daughter's beautiful friend who was supposed to be off limits.

From the moment I laid eyes on Becca, I felt something towards her. A curiosity, a hunger that made me want to know more. I knew it was wrong, but god, was she the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her hair was up in a high ponytail, showing off her beauty. A black bathing suit looked very good on her. I enjoyed the sight very much. 

Never once before did an interest of the girl come across my mind until now, and yet, even though I tried my hardest not to take interest, I couldn't help it. The once ordinary young girl had grown into a beautiful tall brunette with blue eyes and a figure most women would die for.

Seeing her the other night in the kitchen was a surprise, but remembering her stretching up into the cabinet, the thought of her made realize how bad I was attracted to her. She was very spectacular, and I wanted nothing more than to be with her. 

I was not proud with my own thought, but as if my charm prowess took over, it quickly dissipated. I wanted her more than I had ever wanted anyone. I needed to be happy. As if on cue, my office door opened, and in walked a tall blonde with a flashy make-up. Her tight blue dress matches her well, but the problem was she wasn't who I wanted to see. 

‚ÄúKatrine. To what do I owe the pleasure?""""
She smiled as she pushed my chair back and sat next to me.

‚ÄúWhy haven't you come to see me?"""" Her thick Russian accent washed over me as she leaned back batting her lashes. ‚ÄúI had to wait a week and come see you here.""""

‚ÄúI told you, Katrine, I am busy right now.""""

Her brows furrowed as she put on a pout which may have worked on most men, but not me. Tally had perfected that look, and I had grown well accustomed to not falling for it.

‚ÄúI thought you would miss me,"""" she whined as I exhaled with irritation.
Pinching the bridge of my nose, I shook my head and moved away from her.

‚ÄúI told you that I don't do the emotions thing, Katrine."""" 
She looked surprised, and her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWe have been seeing each other for months‚Äì""""

‚ÄúYes, and as I told you the first time‚Ä¶ there is nothing else that will happen. It's just fun, Katrine, and you told me you understood that. I don't understand why you came to my company."""" 

We had one rule, and she knows what it was. 

‚ÄúYou are mine, James."""" Her response was firm as she crossed her arms. ‚ÄúI don't understand why you are acting like this. Don't I make you happy?""""

It was clear this conversation wasn't going anywhere, and with my next appointment arriving in less than an hour, I had things I needed to get done. 

‚ÄúEvette!"""" I yelled, watching as the door opened to reveal my very punctual assistant.

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Valentino?"""" 

‚ÄúCan you please escort Katrine to her car?"""" I asked her, watching as a look of shock crossed Katrine's face.

‚ÄúOf course."""" Evette reached out to Katrine but was quickly pushed back by the rage that began to build beneath her once enticing eyes.

‚ÄúAre you throwing me out?!"""" she shrieked. ‚ÄúYou can't do this to me!""""

Amusement filled me as I leaned back in my chair and watched her. That's unattractive. Perhaps this is for the best.

‚ÄúI think you will see that I can. I appreciate your attention, Katrine, but they will no longer be needed. I do wish you all the best for the future.""""

Cold. That was how I had to be. I never meant to hurt the women I had relations with, but I couldn't allow them to think it would be more.

I was always cast as the bad guy. No matter how many times I told them from the start I didn't want an exclusive relationship, and there would be nothing more than fun, they never listened to me.

‚ÄúYou will regret doing this to me!"""" Katrine warned, causing me to smile.
‚ÄúIs that a threat, Miss Solkova?""""

Laughing, she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, that's a promise. Karma will get you.""""
Turning on her heels, she stormed from my office with Evette left to stand there staring at me.

‚ÄúMr. Valentino, may I say something?""""
‚ÄúOf course, Evette. What's on your mind?"""" I replied.
‚ÄúIf I am going to start having to play defense for you when it comes to women like that‚Ä¶ I am going to have to request a raise, bonus, or something.""""
I laughed at her statement. ‚ÄúIs that right?""""
‚ÄúYes, sir. Call it hazard pay if you will."""" Evette sighed, shaking her head. ‚ÄúWould you like your afternoon coffee, sir?""""
‚ÄúYes, yes. That would be wonderful. Also, I will take the hazard pay into consideration.""""
‚ÄúThank you, sir. I will be back in just a moment.""""

As the door closed, I couldn't help but laugh to myself at her comment. She wanted hazard pay if she had to deal with the women in my life, and honestly, I didn't blame her.

As the afternoon carried on, I found myself caught within my work. That was, until I started scrolling through my phone looking for a document and came across Becca's photo again. Her beautiful figure and carefree smile‚Ä¶ they captivated me.

The thought of boys at my house partying with my daughter and Becca didn't sit well. I knew the girls were of age, but I didn't like the idea that Becca may take an interest in one of those young men. Especially, since the way she acted around me meant she could want me. Oh god! What's the matter with me? This girl has me all out of sorts.

‚ÄúSir, your four o'clock appointment is calling to cancel?"""" my secretary stated from my office door, pulling me from my thoughts.

‚ÄúThat's fine. I actually have an emergency that has come up, and I need to go home. See if you can get them to reschedule for me."""" 

‚ÄúOf course, sir. Do you need anything else?""""

My eyes met hers briefly, but I did not say a word. It was enough for her to understand I was being serious and close the door, giving me time to think through what I was about to do.

‚ÄúPaul,"""" I said into the receiver of my phone as I called my driver, ‚Äúbring the car around.""""
It was time to head home and see how the girls were doing. After all, what kind of responsible adult would I be if I didn't?","[""Read-Submitting to My Best Friend's Dad""]",['assets.dreame.com'],,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=1437529503674158

Chloe is the Site Medic at St Ives Gold Mine. 
 
She says that she has seen a number of initiatives at Gold Fields Australia that demonstrate inclusivity. 
 
She believes, ‚Äúhaving women in mining roles has improved the culture and success at St Ives because it indicates inclusivity, therefore improving relations and equality in the workforce‚Äù. 
 
Chloe feels women are more empowered to stand up and have a voice at Gold Fields because there is more acceptance that women are capable of doing jobs traditionally completed by men.

If the proposal is approved, Coles will be handed the planning and design of the area, which means that they will prioritize their new supermarket's success over the community's interests ‚ùå

The excavation of the carpark will result in it being shut down for over 2 years, destroying the businesses in the area that rely on logistics and on-grade parking.

It's concerning that the Council has a preference for supporting Coles' ambitions over the communities ‚Äì alternate development proposals have been instructed by Council to wait for the Neutral Bay Town Centre Planning Study to be completed, yet this does not apply to Coles.

Furthermore, the public land will be given to Coles, a publicly listed, for-profit company. Woolworths Rangers Road can facilitate all their requirements on their land under their proposal, yet Coles cannot? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

There is no opportunity to achieve the right value capture and profit share of Coles' proposal nor an understanding of what other non-compliances Coles will want to profit from in return for benefiting from community land.

Complete the survey here: https://placescore.org/lc23_do_nsw_lanecove

In 2021, Lane Cove's score was the equal highest score across the nation! Tied with Adelaide, our score was well above the national average. 

The results showed us that our strengths are a sense of personal safety; local businesses that provide for daily needs; elements of the natural environment; landscaping/natural elements; access to neighbourhood amenities; and a sense of belonging in the community.

The 2023 project will see over 60 councils, state agencies, non-profits, corporations, and research organisations unite for this ground-breaking study on liveability. The research aims to uncover the key factors that impact quality of life for Australians, and how governments can prioritise planning that leads to better outcomes.

The Australian Liveability Census asks participants to consider all the attributes of a great neighbourhood ‚Äì social, economic, cultural and physical. What is more important to you ‚Äì local shops or more car parking? More trees or things to do in the evening? We know every community is different and this is a chance for everyone to have their say.

By completing the survey, you not only ensure your voice is heard in shaping the future of Australian neighbourhoods, but there are also 50 x $100 vouchers to be won.

,,6.06517E+14,1.7675E+15,the voice,Sustainable Population Australia,"""Stealing their homes to build ours- the #housingcrisis IS an ecological crisis""

Population expansionists can only visualize the dollars signs in vastly increasing housing supply... there's money to be made in property, bucket loads of it. Build! build! build! is their agenda. Not a thought for those they destroy or displace, after all, they are not human, they (apparently) have no rights, no say in all this- they do not vote, they cannot apply for bank loans or pay rent... they are dispensable in the bigger game!

Taking the pressure out of the demand for housing via greatly reduced immigration intakes and a stabilizing of our population, is definitely not a part of their business model.

But is there enough humanity left in the rest of us to consider those without a voice, those who cannot speak- those who seek only a place to live, as they have done for millions of years? Who will stand up for them?

SPA says- Let us not forget our wildlife. Let us not allow them just to be sacrificed to the property moguls.
Let us all stand up for our creatures, great and small, as united Australians. Let's do it, if for no other reason than that it is what's morally & ethically right. 

No amount of money can buy that feeling morality generates. Let's do this for them, and we guarantee that from this new ethical base, everything else will begin to sort itself out.

,,6.33793E+14,1.05864E+14,the voice,Developing Australian Communities,"Leading Disability Advocate Mr River Night today shared his thoughts and what he describes as ‚Äúutter amazement and offense at the behaviour of political spokespeople and elected officials in Australia over the last month‚Äù.

Mr Night explained in a candid response this week, ‚Äúthese days it seems to me that many political and community members lacking in common sense, seeking to make a name for themselves or remind people they exist, are falling into the same narrative time and time again,

These people these to think,

I want to make a name for myself and make sure people don‚Äôt forget about me. I can‚Äôt do it by doing something constructive and positive because that takes time and actual work. I will get heaps of social media coverage if I just throw some disgusting comments out there to get a good reaction. Just like protesting at a soldier‚Äôs funeral to further traumatise family and outrage others or setting up some ‚Äúgod hates‚Äù banners somewhere near a school, where can those that need attention get it? How do I inflict maximum damage, get maximum shock and awe and gaslight Millions in one swoop? Maybe I should put up some signs out the front of the local adolescent psychiatric service to tell them their mental health needs are a drain on society. Just like a primary school bully looking to feel big and strong because they are suffering themselves, who‚Äôs an easy target for a scared little child that needs to feel good about themselves? Let‚Äôs pick the disabled kid, that‚Äôll be easy!

Mr Night explained, ‚Äúwe saw the NDIS legislation attacked in previous years so that essential service levels and equipment could be stripped, and delegates could bypass any accountability via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

‚ÄúIt appears our leaders prior to the change of Government thought too many people are challenging our poor decisions, so let's cut out their ability to question. It can't possibly be because we have got things wrong when we suggested the person with the permanent spinal injury should be cured by now and not need the funded support we decided to strip them of without warning or any sort of rationale.

‚ÄúWhat did some politicians use then to try and get those disgusting changes passed we see again this week? They suggest everyone on NDIS is using the funds for strippers and holidays to the Gold Coast. They seem to think, that will help them distract from their actual goals because most Australians won‚Äôt realise how absurd that is. Even when the NDIS was still under budget and rolling out, they cried wolf saying it was costing too much, hoping no one fact checked them. 

‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt even a code to claim funds for sex workers in NDIS pricing. We are having trouble getting a new wheelchair approved for kids that is the right size most days, but yeah lets attack NDIS by suggesting the funds are being used for 500 000 participants to get special cuddles from a stranger.

‚ÄúWhen faced with the choice of having staff hours to shower you, dress you, and support you with essential daily living tasks, we can assure the Australian public that the weekly trip to the local brothel isn‚Äôt even on the horizon for the 4.4 million Australia‚Äôs living with disability. It is something many of those stuck on the Disability Support Pension, due to the employment bias, will need to save up for if they do want it.

‚ÄúSex is of course a perfectly legal and normal part of an adult‚Äôs life but those living in the distance past still probably can‚Äôt cope with that idea, let alone sex when you have a disability! Of course, lets continue the narrative that sexuality and identity is off limits to people living with disability, aged care and of course how gross is it that our parents still kiss each other! Ewwww don‚Äôt talk about sex or recognise sexuality in any way no matter how aged appropriate and present in the lives of every Australian. Knowing how uncomfortable people are talking about sex, that‚Äôs a great way to distract and gas light our most vulnerable populations and sadly we see a few people use it as their fall-back script.

‚ÄúWe the 4.4 million Australia‚Äôs living with disability are voters. We also have family that see what we live with and it is a poor move to attack that level of voting public. We are not your playthings and we are not tolerating abuse and neglect. We are not tolerating our elected officials gas lighting and bringing disrepute to the office they hold and privileged position they are paid by us as taxpayers to experience. The essential services 500 000+ Australia‚Äôs receive are not yours to leverage and threaten when they are constantly under budget and cost less than your submarines and the latest railway project in the city.

‚ÄúIt is time Australia stops hiding behind an idea that calling out bigots and leaders that are behaving badly is somehow off limits. We all deserve better from our leaders and if attacking the disabled kid in school is how you get your kicks, make a name, get your feeling of self-worth and importance, what a poor excuse you are for a human being, let alone a politician or community leader.

‚ÄúI feel great sadness for those people that they seek to target the 4.4 million Australians living with disability to spin their political agenda. Bullies need to be seen as what they are; people behaving badly and usually needing support due to the difficulties they have in their own lives. Maybe they were bullied themselves for having the wrong hair colour, skin colour or voice. Break the cycle of abuse and be the change you want to see. 

‚ÄúThere needs to be healthy boundaries as acts that are plain disgusting, we have seen this last month should not be tolerated from our elected officials. Any other employee would be dismissed on the spot. We are a force to be reckoned with and will not tolerate our elected representatives acting like children. Just like a misbehaving child who chooses to bully the disabled kid, perhaps some of those we have heard from this month need a ‚Äòtime out‚Äô.

My daughters, Astin who is 4 and Emery who is 2, are Aboriginal. I made a promise when they were born I would do everything I can to create a better future for them. Will the decisions I make today create a better future for my children and children throughout Townsville, Palm Island and Australia? This is the question I ask myself everyday. 
Will The Voice create a better future for Aboriginal children facing significant challenges right now?
Will The Voice put an end to children as young as 4 smoking marijuana? 
Will The Voice stop the 5 year old who was sexually assaulted by a family member with the child returned to the perpetrator because the authorities don‚Äôt want to remove an aboriginal child from their Aboriginal family? That child is at risk right now. 
Will The Voice stop the high incarceration rates?
Will The Voice bring us together as a nation? 
Will The Voice stop domestic violence?
My view is it won‚Äôt. It will not come close. 
So, I do not support The Voice. 
The Aboriginal people in my family and the many I‚Äôve spoken to in the community and around the country do not support the voice. 
In 10 years time, I would not be able to look my Aboriginal daughters in the eye and say I bent the knee because of emotional blackmail. Which is what we are seeing from this Albanese Government. 
I cannot and I won‚Äôt. 
I am committed to creating a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people. From the ground up, I support a local and regional body that represents them, working with Elders and the grass roots people in the community. Let‚Äôs work together on being solutions focused.
If you can‚Äôt get local governance right, you won‚Äôt get it right nationally. We need local and regional bodies. 
When I looked at my daughters before I left for Canberra I told them I loved them and I would fight for a better future for them. And I will everyday.

Paul Kelly, Editor at Large at the Australian newspaper takes a long hard look the proposed 'Voice' constitutional amendment and concludes the constitutional powers it creates go too far and that Albanese's reliance on goodwill and emotions to support it is an intellectual and moral deception.

Recommended reading by Paul Kelly below.
The Weekend Australian Newspaper
24 March 2023 

""The Australian tragedy of 2023 is about to unfold. In the most important decision of his prime ministership and of his career, Anthony Albanese has finalised his proposed constitutional referendum for an Indigenous voice declaring his mission is to change this country.

It is a tragedy because the Australian Constitution needs to recognise the Indigenous people and what they rightly call the ‚Äútorment of our powerlessness‚Äù, yet the Albanese cabinet decision is an extraordinary and flawed model devoid of bipartisanship or any effort to achieve it.

This referendum is a profound risk for Australia. It has been a long process but with extremely limited consultation with the public ‚Äì no constitutional convention, no parliamentary committee collaborating on the model, no meaningful effort to strike bipartisanship, incredibly not even the release of legal advice from the Solicitor-General and then, on Thursday, the Prime Minister doubling down in a rejection of efforts to modify or temper the model whose flaws have been documented.

In his announcement Albanese endorsed a maximalist voice, thereby guaranteeing a fundamental change in Australia‚Äôs system of parliamentary and executive governance and making a contentious referendum even more contentious. Instead of putting qualifications on the voice Albanese went the other way ‚Äì bowing before the Indigenous working group, he refused any meaningful change to the voice‚Äôs capacity to advise the executive government or address reported concerns of the Solicitor-General and Attorney-General.

This is no way to finalise a referendum question. The optics are disastrous ‚Äì Albanese left the impression of a compliant prime minister submitting to Indigenous demands. There is no reason to change the recent assessment offered to the Sydney Institute by human rights lawyer and voice supporter Frank Brennan: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs proposed is too fixed, too simple, it won‚Äôt fly and I don‚Äôt think the Australian public would ever accept it.‚Äù

For Albanese, it is a personal mission. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to change the country,‚Äù he said. He wants to change the Constitution ‚Äúto recognise the fullness of our history‚Äù. Magnificent vision. But beware prime ministers when they get emotional; it usually means a lurch into unreality.

Do cabinet ministers understand what they signed off on Thursday morning? This is constitutionally empowered group rights tied to constitutionally empowered unlimited representations. It is unprecedented in a dual sense. If carried, it will change our governance and society. There is no way the Coalition could support this model and retain its integrity. It is a sad conclusion from Albanese‚Äôs latest remarks that he seeks to carry this referendum on a tactic of deception ‚Äì relying on goodwill, emotions and the injustice Indigenous people have faced for so long.

This is an intellectual and moral deception. And that needs to be said now because if this referendum is defeated its origins will lie with the decisions Albanese announced on Thursday and the defeat will be his responsibility as the prime decision-maker.

Don‚Äôt blame the Indigenous leaders. Having lacked political power for so long, when they saw a compliant prime minister they went for broke. The trouble is that Albanese has saddled himself with a model riddled with problems that guarantees a tactic of constant undermining by the No side.

The tragedy is that Albanese has conflated the just cause of Indigenous recognition with a model of the voice that breaches too many principles and runs too many risks to be supported.

The essence of this referendum is the insertion into the Constitution of a new institution with a vast constitutional ambit. It is a political institution designed to achieve a political purpose. There are numerous problems with the model but Labor essentially has chosen to ignore them and press ahead in a ‚Äúcrash through or crash‚Äù fatalism.

It is, frankly, incredible that since Albanese outlined his proposed referendum at the Garma Festival seven months ago there has been no public institutional process to examine and assess the proposal ‚Äì just talk behind closed doors. This is an unacceptable foundation on which to ask the Australian people to endorse probably the most far-reaching referendum proposal since Federation.

This is an exceptionally rare referendum since it seeks to create a new chapter in the Australian Constitution. Albanese keeps up the pretence this is a ‚Äúmodest‚Äù proposal. That is false. There will be a new chapter nine in our Constitution that enshrines the voice. It will stand with earlier chapters dealing with the institutions of constitutional nationhood ‚Äì parliament (chapter one), executive (chapter two), judiciary (chapter three) and so on.

It becomes a new advisory arm of government or what barrister Louise Clegg ventures to call ‚Äúa fourth arm of government‚Äù.

The voice is an institution based on group or racial identity but empowered to make representations across the ambit of general laws and policymaking affecting the whole community since Indigenous people are part of the community. This is unprecedented in intent and scope.

We are told by Albanese this will unite the country. How does that work? If the Australian public understood what this institutional arrangement involved would they vote for it? That‚Äôs why Albanese‚Äôs campaign says the two issues are recognition and consultation. But that‚Äôs misleading. 

There are thousands, probably millions, of people who support recognition and consultation but who will oppose the voice because they believe it is divisive or dangerous. Law professor Megan Davis, a member of the working group, told ABC radio the Prime Minister had listened to the working group. She said the voice ‚Äúwill have an extraordinary impact in terms of the government of the day and the parliament‚Äù. It would be proactive; it wouldn‚Äôt wait to be consulted. It is ‚Äúa very, very powerful mechanism‚Äù. We should believe her.

The referendum is about power. The voice will make representations not just to parliament but the executive government including cabinet, ministers and public servants as decision-makers. The idea the voice has limited influence because it is advisory is disingenuous. It will function as a powerful political entity exerting enormous influence. That‚Äôs the entire purpose. It‚Äôs what the whole idea is about.

The constitutional amendment is open-ended and unlimited, such that the voice can make representations on virtually anything ‚Äì from the conditions of Indigenous people to tax, social, economic, resources, cultural, defence and foreign policy.

Trying to impose order on this open-ended constitutional power, Brennan urged the government to a surgical change ‚Äì limiting or excluding its executive government advice in the Constitution, eliminating public servants from any constitutional ambit and letting the parliament take any such decisions.

He got nowhere. His effort trying to get a more viable, acceptable model was seen as counter-productive. Labor wants a voice with maximum interventionist scope, thereby inviting maximum resistance from the Coalition side of politics. This is smart politics? There is a fatalism at work here. Brennan argued that because the voice cannot possibly know about the multitude of decisions envisaged by hundreds of public servants affecting Indigenous people this would open the door to litigation, with the voice claiming it had been overlooked or muted. 

What is the government‚Äôs response? Incredibly, it is enunciation of a new principle, outlined by Albanese, that the parliament and executive government should seek ‚Äúwritten advice from the voice early in the development of proposed laws and policies‚Äù.

The voice doesn‚Äôt just make representations. It needs to be told beforehand ‚Äì confirmation that the voice will be integrated into the system of government and parliament, adding another layer of review, advice and complexity. How far does this extend? Will public servants be required to give notice to the voice every time they are going to make a decision that might affect an Aboriginal person? Will all this await clarification from the High Court?

Albanese is committed to ensuring the voice can make representations to the executive government but has failed to deliver a constitutional amendment that makes this workable. Brennan warns that the impact on the public service will be ‚Äúsomewhat equivalent to ‚Äì though bigger than ‚Äì the major commonwealth administrative law reforms that occurred in Australia in the 1970s‚Äù.

The Prime Minister said people should support the referendum because we will ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù about ourselves. This is insulting and demeaning. It debases what this referendum is about and really says people don‚Äôt need to worry about what Albanese is proposing to do with our Constitution. The more he says this, the more he insults people. On every issue Albanese has deferred to the authority of the voice. This is surely an omen of the future ‚Äì he has previously said it would be a brave government that ignored the advice of the voice. This underlines the sheer enormity of the political nature of this proposal.

How will the public respond? Clegg asked this question in her presentation to the recent Uphold and Recognise conference when she supported a far more modest model for the voice. Will ordinary Australians be impressed when voice members give doorstop TV interviews on parliamentary sitting days? Will they be impressed when there are public brawls over whether the voice has been properly consulted and listened to? Will they be impressed when there are deals done and horse-trading between voice members and federal parliamentarians?

How will advice from the voice stand with advice from the 11 Indigenous democratically elected members of the federal parliament? Who will have greater legitimacy and claim to be listened to?

How will the public service respond? Who in the executive government will get representations from the voice? The minister or the departmental head, or maybe a special unit created in every department and authority? What rules and processes will the public service follow after a representation from the voice arrives? Compliance in fear of retribution, or rejection with all the risks that involves?

Albanese would have made his political calculations. He believes, obviously, the voice will be carried. He must also believe the referendum will damage Peter Dutton‚Äôs standing and leadership though such damage probably depends on the voice being carried when Dutton opposes it. Finally, Albanese must think Australia has reached a turning point ‚Äì that generational change means its historic aversion to supporting referendums is broken and the voice will constitute a new pathway in our political and constitutional life.

These are big calculations with big risks. This looms as a remarkable moment for Australia given our elites ‚Äì the professional classes, corporate leaders and progressive opinion-makers ‚Äì seem united in supporting the referendum, with Labor assuming they will put money behind it. That means corporate leaders need to be held to account and explain why they support such a radical change to our governance, constitutional principles and society in a referendum where the government refuses to even release the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice surrounding its proposal.

This referendum will become the most critical test for many years of the character and leadership quality of those elites.

The federal Opposition Leader and his legal affairs spokesman, Julian Leeser, have called for the release of the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice. This is essential in terms of transparency. It may support the model or it may not ‚Äì but we need to see it. Labor had no problem releasing the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice to attack Scott Morrison over the multiple ministries ‚Äì but no appearance of the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice on putting a new chapter into the Australian Constitution. Not important enough? What does that tell you about the Albanese government?

The government says the best legal minds in the country have been involved in devising the words. That‚Äôs good. The reality, however, is that the best legal minds in the country cannot stop issues arising from the voice being referred to the High Court.

It is true the voice cannot dictate outcomes of the parliament and executive from its representations.

But granting the voice the power to make representations to public servants means the voice needs to know that a public servant has considered the representation in making a decision. Failing that, the voice can seek judicial review of a flawed decision.

Albanese says he feels the weight of history and responsibility. He says Indigenous people have waited long enough and cannot wait any longer, that it is time to recognise 65,000 years of history and that this decision is ‚Äúa matter from the heart‚Äù. All this is true.

The work done by Indigenous leaders over years on this project has been immense. There are many reasons to support the referendum ranging from historic injustice to establishing a mechanism to allow Indigenous people to be consulted and to make representations on issues that concern them. There is no problem with these sentiments or these principles.

The problem is the model of the voice being proposed, its extraordinary constitutional powers and their implications. It is fatuous to say those constitutional powers, once granted, will not be used. The case against the referendum lies in its essence ‚Äì the institutional power it seeks to create. That is where the decision must be weighed and made. Albanese carries the final responsibility for that model ‚Äìand he has failed that test.""

On 8 January 2020 media around the world shared his finding that Black Summer fires had killed one billion animals.

Australia needs to make legislative changes that allow us to heal Country and our community through the fire knowledge and to stop incinerating ecosystems with destructive \'hazard-reduction\' burns.""\n\nüïØÔ∏è Sonja Elwood, wildlife rescuer and rehabilitator of 35 years, and a founding member of the NSW Wildlife Council, which includes 26 wildlife groups representing over 4,000 volunteers in NSW. During Black Summer, Sonja worked with animal rescue organisations and local carers to establish emergency triage centres for wildlife on the South Coast. ""I was working alongside wildlife carers who had lost their homes and whose animals had been lost in the fires. Others had been evacuated and didn\'t know if they had a house to go back to anymore. They would have had every right to just collapse in despair and they didn\'t. They said, what can I do; how can I help; put me on the roster; when do you want me tomorrow? They showed up every day to help our burnt wildlife.""\n\nüïØÔ∏è Head of Programs & Disaster Response at Humane Society International (HSI), Evan Quartermain was one of the first responders on Kangaroo Island where nearly 40% of the island burnt at high severity: ‚ÄúThose were some of the toughest scenes I‚Äôd ever witnessed as an animal rescuer: the bodies of charred animals as far as the eye can see. Every time we found an animal alive it felt like a miracle.‚Äù As a result of this firsthand experience, HSI commissioned a report into the state of Australia\'s disaster response for wildlife, which we\'ll also hear about.\n\nüïØÔ∏è Danielle Celermajer, Deputy Director of the Sydney Environment Institute and leader of the Multispecies Justice project. In the midst of the fires, Danielle started to write about a new crime of our age ‚Äì omnicide, the killing of all. Her book Summertime narrates her firsthand experience of what catastrophic climate change feels like and means not only for humans, but for the animals whose worlds it is ruining. She will share the story of Jimmy and Katy, left to die as piglets on a factory farm floor, who‚Äôd been living safely on the land they shared with the rest of the multispecies community until Black Summer.\n\n---\n\nThe Black Summer Vigil is brought to you by the Department of Animals, Animals Australia, the NSW Wildlife Council, World Animal Protection, Humane Society International and Defend the Wild, with support from WIRES, Firesticks Alliance, Nature Conservation Council of NSW, Wild2Free Kangaroo Rescue, Four Paws, Friends of the Koala and Kangaroos Alive.']",https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=739036127692521

The South Australian Government just rushed through their own state based voice to state parliament adding yet another level of bureaucracy for their state, with our nation wide referendum looming at the end of the year which is nothing more than tokenistic and will do little to nothing for first Australian communities in outback Australia.

,,2.1329E+14,1.39174E+14,the voice,The Week on Wednesday,"Latest Weekend Wrap https://apple.co/3TLXMF0
Ben Davison returns with the Weekend Wrap to breakdown the landslide Labor victory in NSW.  With Labor set to win its biggest ever majority when coming into government from opposition.  

Labor's lower house performance was only bettered by its performance in the upper house where it has achieved a 9% swing and battered the Liberal/National coalition. 

Ben breaks down some of the seats that Labor won, some of the seats where there is a genuine close contest and just why the media continues to be so out of touch.

Chris Minns will become the 47th Premier of NSW with a mandate for change while Dom Perrottet and his supporters in the media are left to shake their heads and claim that it wasn't Labor's focus on wages, more teachers, minimum health service staffing levels, banning privatisation, investing in more local jobs and refusal to get sucked into fringe issues pushed by the media but just that it people thought it was time to mix things up a bit.

Australian Unions President Michele O'Neil will be giving a National Press Club address on Tuesday focussing on how we move to net zero with workers winning rather than paying the bill for billionaires and Ben links this approach to how Labor in NSW campaigned.  Putting people first. 

Unions always put people, particularly their members, first and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow Just look at how teachers, nurses, train drivers, child care workers, cleaners and more have been coming together in union and winning change across Australia.

Ben looks at Insiders treatment of the Voice question announcement and their interview with Attorney General Mark Dreyfus.  Ben does not believe Peter Dutton's support is needed for the referendum to be a success and raises his concern that if the billionaire owned media performs as badly during the referendum as they have during the last few state and federal elections by amplifying loud minority positions it could be a problem, for the media.  

The referendum, like the elections and the marriage equality plebiscite, will be won by people getting involved so check out Yes23 or Unions for YES to see how you can be part of a better future.

In light of the Queensland State Government‚Äôs $2.7 billion demolition and reconstruction of the Gabba Stadium for the 2032 Olympics, the East Brisbane State School community has been informed that their much-loved school will be closed indefinitely, or relocated to Coorparoo. This will mean that there will be no state primary school in East Brisbane, Kangaroo Point or Woolloongabba.

The Queensland State Government has released a survey but the options have been deemed unacceptable by the school community. East Brisbane State School P & C Association has created a parallel survey with additional options, including the option of building a new school within the current catchment.

To complete the survey, click on the link below and fill out the survey online. All comments will be read by the P&C committee and results of the survey will be shared publicly to illustrate community voice and concerns. No personally identifying information will be stored or shared.

Greg warned Australia\'s then‚ÄìPrime Minister in April 2019 that a bushfire catastrophe was coming. He pleaded for support and was ignored, then risked his life dealing with the ramifications on the ground. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt see very far because of the orange smoke. Everything was dark. It was probably 2 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon but it was like night. Then I saw something moving on the side of the road and I walked closer. It was a mob of kangaroos. The speed of that fire with its pyroconvective storm driving it in every direction, they had nowhere to go. They came out of the forest, on fire, and dropped dead on the road. I‚Äôve never seen that. Kangaroos know what to do in a fire. They‚Äôre fast animals. Climate change, driven by the burning of coal, oil, and gas is driving worsening bushfires across Australia, and putting our precious, irreplaceable wildlife in danger.‚Äù\n\nüïØÔ∏è Internationally recognised ecologist and WWF board member, Professor Christopher Dickman oversaw the work calculating the animal deaths from Black Summer. A Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor Dickman already wore the heavy task of being an ecologist during the sixth mass extinction, in the country that has the worst rate of mammalian extinction in the world. On 8 January 2020 media around the world shared his finding that Black Summer fires had killed one billion animals. Sadly, the fires continued for two more months, and his team\'s final count was three billion. This does not include invertebrates: it is estimated 240 trillion beetles, moths, spiders, yabbies and other invertebrates died in the fires.\n\nüïØÔ∏è Legendary wildlife veterinarian Dr Howard Ralph OAM coming up from Southern Cross Wildlife Hospital in the NSW Southern Tablelands.  As put by one of his clinic volunteers, ""If you were an animal suffering or dying, you would want to look up and see Howard looking down at you.‚Äù A qualified human doctor and anaesthetist as well as a veterinary surgeon, Dr Ralph\'s reputation stands apart because where other vets would euthanise wildlife, he goes to great lengths to provide appropriate veterinary care to each individual he meets. From injured red belly black snakes, echidnas and wombats who\'ve been hit by cars, kangaroos and ducks with gunshot wounds, to performing orthopaedic surgery on a microbat, a sparrow or an endangered giant burrowing frog, Dr Ralph is skilled in adapting equipment and techniques to save all those who live on these lands, and says, ‚ÄúIt is frustrating that our wild native animals do not get the respect they deserve."" In a weary interview given during the height of Black Summer, he said, ""The constant input of pain and suffering is tiring emotionally. We deal with that because it needs to be dealt with and the good news from my point of view is that we can do something about it.‚Äù\n\nüïØÔ∏è Coming up from the South Coast, owner of Wild2Free Kangaroo Sanctuary Rae Harvey, as seen in The Bond and The Fire. She is in the sad position of having personally known and cared for a number of Black Summer\'s victims: many of the orphaned joeys she cared for were killed in the fires. (She nearly died herself too.) For three years, she has been unable to even speak their names. Now, for the first time, she will tell the story of the joeys she lost.\n\nüïØÔ∏è  Cultural burning practitioner and Southern NSW Regional Coordinator with Firesticks Alliance, Djiringanj-Yuin Custodian Dan Morgan. Dan practises using Aboriginal knowledge to heal Country. He has worked for 18 years with the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service and is on the board of management for the Biamanga National Park, a sacred area home to the last surviving koalas on the NSW south coast ‚Äì which was partly destroyed by the fires of Black Summer. ‚ÄúThe animals that live on our sacred sites are our Ancestors, it\'s our Cultural obligation to protect them. We have evolved with our Country over thousands of years, nourishing and protecting all living species. Our Country represents our people. So when the fires came, it was devastating to see the aftermath, and the feeling of helplessness was truly traumatising for our people, due to the denial of our Cultural right to manage Country as our Ancestors did for thousands of years prior to colonisation. Australia needs to make legislative changes that allow us to heal Country and our community through the fire knowledge and to stop incinerating ecosystems with destructive \'hazard-reduction\' burns.""\n\nüïØÔ∏è Sonja Elwood, wildlife rescuer and rehabilitator of 35 years, and a founding member of the NSW Wildlife Council, which includes 26 wildlife groups representing over 4,000 volunteers in NSW. During Black Summer, Sonja worked with animal rescue organisations and local carers to establish emergency triage centres for wildlife on the South Coast. ""I was working alongside wildlife carers who had lost their homes and whose animals had been lost in the fires. Others had been evacuated and didn\'t know if they had a house to go back to anymore. They would have had every right to just collapse in despair and they didn\'t. They said, what can I do; how can I help; put me on the roster; when do you want me tomorrow? They showed up every day to help our burnt wildlife.""\n\nüïØÔ∏è Head of Programs & Disaster Response at Humane Society International (HSI), Evan Quartermain was one of the first responders on Kangaroo Island where nearly 40% of the island burnt at high severity: ‚ÄúThose were some of the toughest scenes I‚Äôd ever witnessed as an animal rescuer: the bodies of charred animals as far as the eye can see. Every time we found an animal alive it felt like a miracle.‚Äù As a result of this firsthand experience, HSI commissioned a report into the state of Australia\'s disaster response for wildlife, which we\'ll also hear about.\n\nüïØÔ∏è Danielle Celermajer, Deputy Director of the Sydney Environment Institute and leader of the Multispecies Justice project. In the midst of the fires, Danielle started to write about a new crime of our age ‚Äì omnicide, the killing of all. Her book Summertime narrates her firsthand experience of what catastrophic climate change feels like and means not only for humans, but for the animals whose worlds it is ruining. She will share the story of Jimmy and Katy, left to die as piglets on a factory farm floor, who‚Äôd been living safely on the land they shared with the rest of the multispecies community until Black Summer.\n\n---\n\nThe Black Summer Vigil is brought to you by the Department of Animals, Animals Australia, the NSW Wildlife Council, World Animal Protection, Humane Society International and Defend the Wild, with support from WIRES, Firesticks Alliance, Nature Conservation Council of NSW, Wild2Free Kangaroo Rescue, Four Paws, Friends of the Koala and Kangaroos Alive.']",https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=302195858967105

The Senate is conducting an inquiry into bank closures in regional Australia, and this is a huge step in the right direction.

Our party campaigned hard for this inquiry because we saw the devastating impact that branch closures were having.

Small businesses and their customers lose access to cash. Vulnerable customers lose the certainty and security of face-to-face banking, forced to bank online where they are the primary targets of sophisticated scammers. Towns lose money as their residents who have to travel to larger centres to do their banking also spend their shopping dollars there.

More than 300 branches have closed in the last two years. Many towns have lost their last bank. The banks claim they‚Äôre only responding to people banking online but it‚Äôs a lie. The inquiry has already heard evidence that banks are forcing customers online, by harassing them to register and removing the branch services.

The Big Four banks are making obscenely high profits in part because of free money they get from the Term Funding Facility. 
The banks are on the public dole, and they repay the people with a knife in the back.

,,3.37262E+15,7.98609E+14,the voice,Sally Townley - Independent,"One of the more common clich√©s I hear as an Independent candidate is that a vote for an Independent is a wasted vote, that an Independent without party backing and support can't achieve any real change.

That's a shame to hear. Because Australia has a healthy history of forging political and social change on the back of Independent candidates' consciences and convictions. 

Independents ‚Äî and only Independents ‚Äî have the flexibility to vote in the interests of their local community, regardless of party stripes and ideology. They can introduce their own Bills that the major parties might find too difficult, too controversial or too divisive to pursue. The can vote honestly and speak freely without constraint by party factions or partners. They can drive open and transparent discussion, and bring to the fore issues, especially local issues, that may get ignored or passed over by the major parties seeking bigger targets.

It is highly unlikely that an Independent has donors or other lobbyists that he or she must ""repay"" when forming policy or voting on the floor of parliament. It is almost inconceivable that an Independent has a backroom bevy of friends with special interests that must be serviced. It is almost impossible that an Independent would ever be in the position to game the system by promising gifts to his or her electorate at the expense of another. 

Fact is, an Independent candidate standing (or falling) on their merits is the epitome of democratic process and representation. 

And, despite the ""wasted vote"" rhetoric, an Independent can effect real change. In a hung parliament, the major parties need to work with Independents, to negotiate and collaborate to pass legislation which, in turn, gives Independents a significant voice in how legislation is shaped.

When I get asked the wasted-vote question, I often ask people to explain what their last vote, their non-Independent vote, got them.

In Coffs Harbour, we have overcrowded schools with no indication from the current government that any new schools are in the pipeline until all other avenues (demountables, enforcing catchments, shuffling students) have been exhausted. We have a teacher crisis that has half the workforce thinking of quitting. A social and affordable housing crisis that has been a decade in the making and a ""solution"" that delivers fewer bedrooms to the needy and more profits to developers. A coastal lake that has been ranked amongst the worst in the world from poorly regulated agricultural practices, with little investigation and little in the way of real sanctions. A government that wants to sell off part of the Jetty Foreshores for private residential development despite the wishes of the overwhelming majority of locals.

These are the issues I have talked with locals over the years and most particularly over the last few weeks. And in hearing these questions, the only conclusion, the only logical conclusion, is that the current government isn't listening or simply doesn't care.

And if that's not a wasted vote, what is?",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=3372617949663873

Van Badham and Ben Davison return home from their award winning run at the Adelaide Fringe Festival to discuss the NSW State Election, on March 25th, the issues, the leaders, the optional preferential system and the seats to watch.  It is looking like a tight election but if NSW wants, as the polls are suggesting they do, guaranteed minimum staffing levels in hospitals, public schools that have resources for every student, wages that are going up and leadership that's focused on the issues that matter to everyday people then Labor should win. 

Of course Unions NSW and the many affiliate unions that are made up of workers in sectors cut, smashed and abandoned by Perrottet's Liberals are campaigning and you can become a union member to protect your rights at work, whatever state you are in, at australianunions.org.au/wow 

In Victoria we suffered through a TERF-Nazi joint rally on the weekend.  Van explains how TERFs are NOT feminists, are a vocal EXTREMIST minority and that Liberal MPs and Senators defending those associated with these individuals are putting a toxic set of values into our political discourse.  Van and Ben offer their solidarity to members of the Trans community and all minority groups who would have, understandably, been concerned by the scenes over the weekend.

The Voice is a step closer with the machinery of the referendum set to pass the parliament.  The laws on how to run the referendum needed updating given we haven't had a referendum since the invention of social media!

And there is good environmental news about the capturing of carbon which may or may not being able to supply every home with enough baking soda to ensure no fridge is ever smelly again!

Van also acknowledges our Cadre and Extend the Reach Supporters who have gone to www.buymeacoffee.com/weekonwednesday and helped us grow our audience.

We are absolutely thrilled to announce we have gained support this month with Australian icon Dami Im joining our global fight.

Dami Im gained international recognition after she earned second place representing Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest, and today, she is dedicated to using the strength of her voice for crucial change.

The South Korea-born songstress shared that she could not stand by any longer after hearing the horrendous statistics inflicted on children worldwide.

‚ÄúI want to support these rescue efforts, and I believe my voice and profile can help shine the spotlight on this global scourge to see more and more children freed,‚Äù Dami said.

Our Australian CEO Paul Mergard is thrilled to have Dami onboard as an ambassador and said having Dami‚Äôs support and projected voice to share our message around the ongoing sexual exploitation of children will be life-changing for so many.

Thank you, and welcome, Dami. We‚Äôre really looking forward to working with you.

This cannot and must not continue.

On behalf of the Campbelltown City Council, I am delighted to announce that we are hosting our first-ever Ramadan and Eid Festivals this year. This is a momentous occasion for our diverse community, as we come together to celebrate and embrace our cultural differences.
As a council, we understand the importance of acknowledging and respecting the traditions and customs of our community members. We believe that these festivals are an excellent opportunity to showcase the rich and diverse cultural heritage of our region and promote a sense of inclusivity and unity.
During this Ramadan, Muslims around the world observe fasting and perform special prayers. The Campbelltown City Council will organize an event call Ramadan on Q to mark this occasion on 15th of April Friday at Lithgow Street from 4.30pm to 11.30pm., Campbelltown.
Similarly, the Eid Festival, which marks the end of the Ramadan month, will be celebrated on the 30th  of April at Coronation Park, Minto -2566 from 11am to 8 pm. This event will be a joyous occasion for Muslims, as they gather to celebrate with their families and friends. The Campbelltown City Council has planned various activities, such as food stalls, cultural performances, and family-friendly activities, to make the day memorable for everyone.
I would like to thank all members of the Campbelltown community for their support and participation in these festivals. We look forward to a month of celebration and community spirit during Ramadan, and we hope that everyone will come together to celebrate the Eid Festival as well.

,,2.33484E+14,1.4841E+11,the voice,MS Australia,"Many of us know someone affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) ‚Äì a friend, a family member, a colleague or a personal diagnosis.

MS is the most commonly acquired chronic neurological disease affecting young adults and affects three times more women than men in Australia. 

As yet, there is no cure.

Many people living with MS who require support from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) find the scheme fails to meet their needs. 

Inadequate disability support for people who rely on it forces considerable pain and distress on the person and their loved ones. 

The NDIS review taking place right now gives us optimism, as it is a significant opportunity to improve many people's lives, including those with MS. 

MS Australia is calling for the NDIS to include six key priorities:

Most candidates for election in Goulburn and Monaro electorates have said they are personally opposed to Veolia‚Äôs current Tarago incinerator proposal.

But personal opposition doesn‚Äôt do anything to stop Veolia moving ahead with the incinerator in the State Significant Planning Process which is stacked against local communities.

What we need is a commitment that their party will ban incineration in Tarago and the Southern Tablelands, something that could quickly and easily be achieved via regulation amendment.

Only the Shooters Fishers and Farmers Party, The Greens NSW and Legalise Cannabis NSW Party (LCNSW) have a policy to do so and we applaud them for that. 

The NSW Liberal Party, NSW Nationals and NSW Labor parties refuse. This means a Liberal, National or Labor government will continue to support the current NSW Government policy which says incinerators can be built in 4 locations across the state, one of which is Tarago (Southern Goulburn Mulwaree).

If you‚Äôre thinking of voting for Liberal, National or Labor - time to tell them they need their party to commit to banning the Tarago incinerator if they want your vote. Otherwise consider voting for a party that will!

It's clear the Narrabeen Sports High community is fed up with the way the government has handled works on the school. 

As a mum of kids in public schools, I know how frustrating it is when it feels like a lack of funding is getting in the way of your child's education. 

I'm stepping up and making sure Narrabeen Sports High has its voice heard: if elected, I won't just look to refurbish the school, I'll work hard to get the funding needed to properly rebuild it. 

It's unacceptable that kids in our community are going to a school that doesn't have enough classrooms, lacks heating and cooling, has inadequate toilets and is rife with water damage. 

Over the past year I've chatted to many parents in the Narrabeen Sports High community and they all say the same thing: this rebuild is desperately needed, and the government hasn't listened to them. 

This election is an extraordinary opportunity to get the government to come to the table on important local issues like this one: the polls show we're likely heading towards a minority government, and independents may hold the balance of power. 

If I'm in a position where I'm negotiating with the major parties, I'll bring this to their attention and make obtaining funding for the rebuild an absolute priority - our childrens' education is too important.

Australia has made great progress in the past under the previous Liberal government when we became the first country in the world to ban the import of lion parts, rhino horn and elephant ivory. 

This was achieved by working closely with Donalea Patman from the Love of Wildlife who brought to my attention the abhorrent cruelty of the trophy hunting industry. 

This cruel industry saw canned hunting where lions were bred for the bullet, rhinos had their calves sliced whilst sleeping to make it easier to cut their horns off and elephants were poisoned with cyanide. 

Through her advocacy and my strong voice in Parliament we put a stop to these imports, we disrupted this abhorrent industry and stopped Australians from taking part. 

But at a state level much more can be done to stop domestic sales of parts and trophies. 

On a federal level Labor Labor needs to follow the lead of the former Liberal government and instead of just talking about wildlife actually do something to improve the life of our wildlife right now!

Scarlett:

I hissed as he pulled out of me, the feeling of being empty somewhat being foreign despite the discomfort that I felt during the experience. My body was somewhat sore; however, this was nevertheless, one of the most beautiful nights of my life.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you mark me?‚Äù I asked, frowning in confusion. He wouldn‚Äôt even let me mark him, and instead, he chose to take control of the whole night, not that I minded, I was just confused by his action.

‚ÄúBecause I never planned to‚Äù he answered coldly. The gentle and sweet man who was holding me in his arms earlier seemed to disappear all of a sudden. I frowned, and forcing myself to sit up, my body being sore just wanted me to rest.

‚ÄúAlexander, this is not a joke to play around with‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not playing you, Scarlett. I never planned to mark you, and I believe that you‚Äôre not stupid enough to know that an Omega would never be in the same rank as an Alpha‚Äù he said coldly. My heart raced against my ribcage as he put on his boxers and pants. He turned to face me, and with hard eyes, he glared at me, waiting for an answer.

His green eyes met my blue ones, and shaking my head, I tried to process what he was saying. The man couldn‚Äôt be serious, he couldn‚Äôt be saying this, could he?

‚ÄúThen why did you invite me here? I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI was curious on how it would feel to  my mate. Needless to say, you are the best I‚Äôve been with; however, the two of us know that it is Delilah who I am in love with; therefore, I do believe that you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just took my virginity to be with a different woman?‚Äù I asked, stopping him ‚Äúhell, if you‚Äôre in love with a different‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if you want to stay alive, I will suggest that no one hears of this. Otherwise, I will be ripping that tongue out of your mouth, feeding it to you before I‚Äôve killed you, do you understand me?‚Äù He asked, glaring daggers at me. Tears brimmed my vision and nodding in understanding, I gripped the blanket over my body, hiding it from his eyes ‚Äúgood, now it is time for your rejection‚Äù

‚ÄúAlex, please. The two of us have been friends‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat friendship ended when we grew older. I am not saying that you did anything wrong, on the contrary, but we are of different ranks, and omega can be matched with an Alpha‚Äù he said, stopping me. His words tore into my soul like nothing else, and tightening my grip on the blanket, I waited for his rejection as my heart throbbed. My wolf broke, but I promised her to make it up to her. I promised her that if she doesn‚Äôt show her pain to him, that I would be helping her heal. Maybe we would be getting a chance with another mate, maybe our fate would be different.

""I, Alpha Alexander D‚ÄôAngelo, reject you, Scarlett De Luca, as my mate and Luna‚Äù I kept my eyes on him as he spoke his words, not reacting to his cold words. He frowned in confusion, expecting his words to break me, they did, but I wasn‚Äôt going to show it to him, not when I did nothing to deserve the rejection.

‚ÄúAnd I, Omega Scarlett De Luca, accept your rejection, Alpha Alexander D‚ÄôAngelo‚Äù he frowned in confusion as he watched me lay on the pillow, covering myself with the blanket, hiding my face. I was thankful that it was a while past eleven and that we were at my house. My house at the pack was at the far end of it, and having lost my parents at a young age, I‚Äôve been living alone, thanks to Alexander‚Äôs father, Mathew D‚ÄôAngelo, who allowed me to stay in his pack after their death.

He walked to my side and sat on the edge of the bed for a second, running a finger over my forehead before pulling his hand away and clenching his fist. A manner that he had since we were kids. I squeezed my eyes shut, and holding the blanket tighter, I turned around, giving him my back before I felt him getting up from the bed and walking out of the house.

‚ÄúGood night, Scarlett, I will show myself out‚Äù he said, not bothering to wait for me to respond as he walked out of my room, then my house, and it wasn‚Äôt until I was sure that he was away from my house that I allowed myself to sob.

Both because my heart broke at the fact that the man that I couldn‚Äôt help but imagine myself with as I grew older. He was the one support that I had growing up, and it wasn‚Äôt until he met HER, that he changed.

The fact that I also knew that I couldn‚Äôt say anything about it didn‚Äôt escape my mind. The way he rejected me, looked at me, and even spoke to me kept playing in my head, causing my wolf to whimper in pain. Her whimpers were ones that broke me, mostly because I knew that I couldn‚Äôt keep her safe. I couldn‚Äôt be that human who was good enough for her.

I had lost my family as a child, and therefore, when I shifted for the first time, I was the only one without my parents around. Alpha Mathew was there to support me alongside his Luna, Alexander‚Äôs mum, Katlyn D‚ÄôAngelo, as they both made me obey and were gentle on me. I had submitted to them without question, they were my only family.

Then when Alpha Mathew chose to step aside to have his son as Alpha, I knew that I would submit to him, why? Because on the very night that I shifted, the night of my eighteenth birthday, I knew that he was mine and I was his. But that was a month ago, a month with him quiet with no response to our mating bond.

No reaction, and not even a simple glance of satisfaction, nothing at all.

And now I understand why.

The man was taunting me, wanting a taste, but also wanting to let me go when he was done; however, as I was ordered, I was going to stay quiet.

I would suck it up, and wash my face, ignoring all the pain I lived through, and I was going to suck it up‚Ä¶

Therefore, forcing myself out of my bed, my sore legs caused me to stumble a bit. But nevertheless, I managed to reach the bathroom as I stared at my reflection.

‚ÄúYou, Omega Scarlett, are not going to weaken in front of the Alpha. Not today, not tomorrow, and not ever, do you understand?‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------------
Alexander:

‚ÄúWhat do you mean she‚Äôs gone?‚Äù I asked Carter, my best friend and beta, glaring at him.

‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt find her at her house. I knocked a few times, and when she didn‚Äôt respond, I broke the door down, but she wasn‚Äôt there‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFind her‚Äù I said, stopping him. He nodded and ran out to follow my order, knowing that I wasn‚Äôt joking around at this point.

My girlfriend, Delilah, frowned when she saw my concern; however, she didn‚Äôt know that Scarlett was my mate. She didn‚Äôt know that I rejected her for her over a month ago.

‚ÄúShe left, why are you upset about it?‚Äù She asked, crossing her arms over her chest as she walked toward me. Her blonde hair, and brown eyes met my green ones, and shaking my head at her I walked past her without saying a word. I tried catching her scent, but it was nowhere to be found, and being the pack‚Äôs orphan, and omega, I knew that losing her would only anger my father.

‚ÄúI am talking to you, Alex‚Äù Delilah said, wrapping her hand around my arm, stopping me. I growled in warning, forcing her to let go, and shaking her head in question, Delilah tried processing what just happened.

‚ÄúI do not care about her; however, if my father finds out that she is lost, I am in for more trouble than I want to handle. The two of us know how much he cares about her, and we both know that he would go head over heels when he finds out about this‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe left on her own. You can‚Äôt possibly be blamed for that, Alex‚Äù I took a deep breath, forcing myself not to respond as I knew that she didn‚Äôt just leave because she wanted to. I knew that watching me with Delilah broke her more than she let out, and seeing as she didn‚Äôt say a word about it, I eventually knew that she would collapse; however, I didn‚Äôt really expect her to leave.

‚ÄúDelilah, can you please leave me alone to think? For crying out  loud, just give me my space‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI am your girlfriend, and I don‚Äôt think that watching you get worried over another woman should be something that I allow‚Äù Delilah snapped, stopping me. I sighed and turned around to face her. I cupped her cheeks and made her look at me, quickly leaning in to peck her lips. The kiss felt different, and not a good different, much like the other kisses that we‚Äôve been sharing since that night.

‚ÄúMy gorgeous neonata, you know that the last thing I want right now is for you to be upset; but I really have to find her before we‚Äôve gotten in trouble with father‚Äù I said, gently running my finger over her jawline. Delilah sighed but nodded, allowing me to take a step back without complaining this time.

I tried to catch her scent, knowing that since she was my mate, rejected or not, the bond between us was still unbreakable, especially since I never marked my chosen mate, or in other words, my girlfriend.

‚ÄúWhere are you, Scarlett?‚Äù I hissed, walking around the pack‚Äôs ground. I knew that she wasn‚Äôt here, I just needed to know which path she took so as not to get caught; however, the woman was smart enough to take different routes to prevent me finding her. Typical Scarlett‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAnd where the  are you even going?‚Äù

**************************************

‚ÄúWhat do you mean she‚Äôs gone missing?‚Äù Dad asked angrily. He got up from his chair on the dining table just as we entered the house, and seeing as she didn‚Äôt come to dinner, he knew that something was off.

‚ÄúIt is not Alpha Alexander‚Äôs fault. She left the pack unnoticed‚Ä¶‚Äù Delilah started only to be stopped by dad banging the table, stopping her. Alpha Mathew, my father, was a man who not only took Scarlett in as his daughter, I knew that he had hoped that the two of us would be mates. He didn‚Äôt know that his wish did come true, it would be a secret that would be dying with the two of us.

‚ÄúNo one addressed you, Delilah. If you are on my dining table, I do not expect you to believe that you would mean anything more to me‚Ä¶‚Äù

I let out a low growl of warning, not wanting him to insult her, and he let out a quiet chuckle in response.

‚ÄúThe girl was a good friend of yours, how could you be so calm‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have been searching for her all morning; however, if she chose to leave on her own, I do not think that it is my responsibility as her Alpha to look for her. Yes, I did search when another Alpha would have banned her from the pack, making her a rogue, if‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúScarlett wouldn‚Äôt have left without a reason, Alex, we all know that‚Äù mom said, stopping me ‚Äúwhatever her reason is, we will know of it when she is back. Until then, we do not want you to stop the search for her. I don‚Äôt think she would last long out of the pack; however, no matter how long she stays away, when he‚Äôs back, she is not to be kicked out‚Äù

I nodded in understanding, knowing that objecting to anything would only end up being against me. I knew that they took her in as a daughter after both her parents sacrificed their lives to save me and mom. Had it not been for them getting us out of the burning building when I was a child, we would have been dead. They died unable to leave while we were saved. Scarlett was barely a few months old back then, and she too was saved from the fire. Her mom handed her to mine at the last minute before a wall fell between us, locking them inside as we walked out.

They died in that building, either by suffocation, the fire itself, or the crashing walls around them, and we honored their sacrifice by taking their daughter in.

‚ÄúAnd I want to know her reason for leaving, from her, when she is back, do you understand me, Alex?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, father‚Äù I said, looking at Delilah who I knew wanted to make a comment. I glared at her not to before taking a seat beside my mom, Scarlett‚Äôs seat was empty, and wanting to take a chance to sit on it, Delilah walked toward it making me shake my head at her behavior. Dad banged the table in warning, stopping her, and taking a step back, she was reminded of her place.

‚ÄúDelilah, child, I will give you this last warning, and I do not care whether you or your mate like it or not‚Ä¶‚Äù dad said, glaring at her ‚Äúyou are an outsider, not from this pack. I would suggest that you remind yourself to mind your  limits with me. You are not this pack‚Äôs Luna, regardless of my son being an Alpha; therefore, if I find you crossing your limits with the pack members, you will find me standing in front of you, do you understand me?‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------------
Scarlett:

I put a hand on my stomach as I walked around the streets, heading to the apartment that I rented, having finished my last shift of the day.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, my love, mummy will keep you safe‚Äù I said, speaking to my baby. It killed me to admit, but knowing that Alexander didn‚Äôt know that he was going to have a baby made me feel somewhat guilty. But I also knew the consequences of telling him that I was, and I knew that I couldn‚Äôt handle them.

A child of a mating who I was forced to hide in fear of getting told to abort it.

I didn‚Äôt want to, and I was determined to protect my child if it cost my life, and if the man threatened me as not to reveal the fact that he cheated on his ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô to sleep with me, wanting to feed his sexual hunger; then he was not going to hesitate to tell me to lose the child in fear of everyone‚Äôs reaction.

Having been working for a month before I left the pack and two months now that I was away from it, I knew that I could support myself and my child, if only a little when I didn‚Äôt have any allowance from Alpha Mathew anymore. The man has more than enough for me, and I was thankful for being able to save up most of the allowance he gave me over the year when I initially planned to get myself a car, but getting pregnant changed my plans for me, not that I minded. At least I knew that I wasn‚Äôt going to be alone, theoretically, I was going to start my own family, something which I was deprived from.

No one knew about my job, and instead, everyone thought that I was studying for university exams, or doing my projects. I was, when everyone fell asleep, I would study, but during the day, I was between my classes which I switched to being online, and between work to afford a living for myself and my child.

I entered one of the grocery stores on the way, getting myself something to eat, a loaf of bread, a few bottles of water, and two bottles of peanut butter and jam should last me a few days at least. The less I spent on myself, the more I could save for my child‚Äôs needs, and being a wolf, I knew that I didn‚Äôt have much time anyway.

Thankfully, when I started working, I was already showing and they could only assume that I was in my sixth month. My stomach was hidden back at the back under the mom jeans that I bought while back at the pack, and the loose shirts that they were used to me wearing; therefore, thankfully, when I did join them for dinner mainly, most of my day was either spent out of the pack or at my house, and when the first full moon hit, I made sure to pretend to go and shift with ‚Äòfriends‚Äô that I didn‚Äôt really have, outside the pack‚Äôs grounds. Alexander didn‚Äôt really care, and since that was the case, his father didn‚Äôt question me. But, when everything came down to it, no one suspected a thing.

‚ÄúThat would be five dollars, ma‚Äôam‚Äù the cashier said, looking at the things that I bought. She looked at my stomach and smiled, handing me another loaf of bread, as well as a bottle of milk ‚Äúthese are on the house, I wish you a safe delivery, ma‚Äôam‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you so much‚Äù I said, putting a hand on my stomach.

‚ÄúYou are very welcome, ma‚Äôam‚Äù she said, nodding at me.

I smiled and paid the woman before putting my things in a bag and walking back to my apartment. I was hungry, I knew that, I lost weight over the past few months that I was staying alone, and I knew that it was due to the fact that I was barely eating enough to make sure that my baby didn‚Äôt die on me, or that I didn‚Äôt starve. My diet mostly consisted of bread and whatever I could spread on it, or leftovers at the restaurant. I didn‚Äôt mind, they filled me wonderfully, and at this point, I had no better option.

I entered my apartment, making sure to lock the door behind me before sitting on the floor in the middle of what was supposed to be the living room. I smiled as I placed my hand on my stomach before making myself a sandwich and eating it.

I took a few sips of water before getting up and setting the things in the mini fridge that I had in the living room, something that I bought with my first actual salary when I moved here, knowing that I would at least need it to store food.

My baby moved inside me, and feeling the kick, I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle despite it being somewhat harder than it normally was.

‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôre hungry, but for now, we‚Äôre going to need to settle for this quantity. You know that mummy cannot afford to buy food every day, we still need to have money when you‚Äôre here‚Äù I said, running a hand on my stomach, rubbing it gently ‚ÄúI promise to shower you with the love that I was deprived of. I promise you to protect you from anyone that would try to harm you‚Äù

I got up from the floor and walked toward the bedroom, turning the lights on before dusting my bed. My night light which was beside my head was unplugged, and plugging it in, I turned it on and turned off the light, giving myself a dimmer aroma.

Smiling at myself, I stripped out of my clothes, knowing that I would need to wash them tomorrow morning before heading to work. But for now, I needed to get enough rest before getting up early to study for my finals. Thankfully, they were going to be online, but I was more worried about wanting to head to the university to see my professors if needed. For now, that was not going to be the case, but if that ever happened, and anyone from the pack was around, either searching for me, which I doubted, or actually attending any classes, another thing that I didn‚Äôt consider possible since they made sure that I entered one of the schools where none of them wanted.

Regardless of the previous Alpha and Luna‚Äôs love for me, I was still one of the lowest ranked at the pack. Especially after losing my parents.

Most of them didn‚Äôt remember the sacrifice that my parents did to save our Luna and current Alpha. Had it not been for their sacrifice, I might have had my family, but the pack wouldn‚Äôt have had a Luna, an heir, and an Alpha who had his sanity in place.

Shaking my head at myself, I put on comfortable pajamas and a pair of socks to warm my feet. My wolf has been weakening as well, and despite her body being warmer than that of a normal human, it still didn‚Äôt keep me warm enough to ensure keeping enough energy and losing less calories that would end up killing us out of starvation.

‚ÄúGood night, my little, please try and let mummy sleep a little. We both need to rest to be able to function tomorrow‚Äù I said, rubbing my stomach gently. My baby kicked my stomach and I couldn‚Äôt help the laugh that escaped my mouth at that, the feeling being one of the best that I keep experiencing despite the pain that followed it. It was a good pain, I had to admit, but it was still painful.

‚ÄúI love you too, baby‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------------
Alexander:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care whether or not she is dead. I want her body if you have to bring it‚Äù dad snapped, glaring at me.

‚ÄúMy men are on the search for her. The girl has not been to her university in months, if she was still in the city, we would have found her already‚Äù I snapped, glaring at my father. The fact that he was speaking to me in such a sense annoyed me, especially since I was the one who was Alpha, and not him.

His eyes widened and a low growl escaped his chest before he wrapped his hand around my neck, choking me ‚ÄúMathew!‚Äù

Mom‚Äôs voice broke through the silence of the room, and growling in warning, dad had her stop before she said a word about it ‚Äúthe girl‚Äôs family sacrificed their lives for your and your mother‚Äôs sake. The least we could do is ensure that their daughter is safe until she‚Äôs found her mate, do you understand me?‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt know how much his words tore through my chest. If he found out that I was her mate and that I rejected her, then I was more than just dead in his eyes. The man wouldn‚Äôt even give me a grave.

He removed his hand from around my neck, and taking a step back, he nodded toward mom and the two of them walked toward the door. He looked at me over his shoulder, stopping at the door for a second before he spoke ‚ÄúI want her found, and I don‚Äôt care what it costs you. Whether she is alive, dead, in the city, or somewhere away from it. I want to know why she ran away, and I want to know of her whereabouts; otherwise, I will be sure that you pay for her leaving the way that she did‚Äù

The man walked out of the house before I could say a word, and sitting on the couch, I pinched the bridge of my nose, knowing that I didn‚Äôt know what I could do. The fact that my mate was away from the pack was something, the fact that I couldn‚Äôt even stand looking at Delilah was another thing. Her living with me in the house right now only angered me more than I could have imagined, and I couldn‚Äôt help but regret both sleeping with and rejecting Scarlett.

‚ÄúAlex?‚Äù Delilah said, entering the house carrying a bunch of groceries. Her voice, which was once music to my ears now angered me, and seeing as I didn‚Äôt get up to greet her like I normally would have before that night, Delilah let out a low whimper.

She handed one of the maids the grocery bags that she was carrying, and putting her car keys on the table, she walked toward me.

‚ÄúWhen are you going to tell me what I did so wrong that you‚Äôre not bothering to look at me?‚Äù She asked, sitting on the couch beside me. The two of us have grown more distant over the past three weeks, and it was also due to the fact that she was either growing too protective, or trying to get me to make her pregnant. She knew that I didn‚Äôt want it, but I wasn‚Äôt stupid as not to realize that she stopped taking birth control since Scarlett disappeared and I started my search for her.

‚ÄúYou can start by going back to your birth control pills and stop‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is my body, and what enters it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you can dream about me touching you, Delilah‚Äù I said, glaring at her. She looked down at her lap, watching as I got up from the couch ‚ÄúI will not risk you getting pregnant‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened to the ‚Äòfamily‚Äô that we wanted to build? As far as I know, a family was built when two mated and had their child. You‚Äôre refusing to mark me, and now you‚Äôre just annoyed that I want us to try for a baby. You have been since that slut‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOne more word about her, and I will be sure that you don‚Äôt see the next light of day‚Äù I snapped, stopping her. She looked down at her feet, and taking a deep breath, I got down on my knees in front of her and laid my head on her lap, not wanting her to be upset ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, dad just got on my nerves and I‚Äôm taking my anger out on you. I shouldn‚Äôt be doing that‚Äù

She looked at me and sighed before putting her hand on my head, gently massaging my scalp as she ran her fingers through my hair. Dad was right, maybe knowing that she was dead would be better, at least bringing her body here might help my wolf be at ease. However, me being in constant conflict with him and with my relationship with Delilah was something that I could no longer stand.

‚ÄúIs it about her again?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, and the topic itself is starting to annoy me; especially since both he and mom are blaming me because she left‚Äù I said, not looking up at her. In theory, they were right. I knew that she left because she could no longer stand looking at me with Delilah. I saw it in her eyes the first time she walked out of her house, three nights after I took her virginity.

She had kept herself locked inside the house throughout the next three days to the point where we actually thought that something happened to her. I knew that she wasn‚Äôt dead, I couldn‚Äôt help but check on her, listening to her beating heartbeat within the walls of her house.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt keep blaming you for her leaving, Alexander. She chose to leave, why are you the one to blame?‚Äù Delilah asked.

‚ÄúI am the Alpha of this pack, and we all know that it is my responsibility to ensure that everyone in the pack is safe. Scarlett was part of the pack, and whether or not we chose to like it, she lost everything for our sake‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was in the past, Alex, you know that you and your father have paid her more‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that any money would repay for the sacrifice her parents did, Delilah‚Äù I said, stopping her. It was another thing that annoyed me about her. Delilah believed that everything could be solved with money. I raised my head from her lap before getting up from the ground to head out to look for her.

I still had one place to search for her at. It was one of her favorite caf√©s, and if she wasn‚Äôt there, I didn‚Äôt know where she would be at this point.

Delilah frowned in confusion when she saw me heading to get my keys and wallet, and getting up from the couch, she shook her head in confusion, wanting to either stop me, or question where I was going. She knew that I wouldn‚Äôt answer if she asked, but I knew that she wouldn‚Äôt be ‚ÄòDelilah‚Äô, if she didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of this.

‚ÄúFor crying out loud, just spend one night with me. That is all I am asking‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI have responsibilities to take care of, and I don‚Äôt think that playing house with you for your egoistic reasons is going to get things done; therefore, my apologies, Delilah, but I will have to leave‚Äù I said, getting my jacket from the closet. My heart ached, but I prayed that I would find her, dead or alive, to give myself a sense of peace that she was either okay and happy, or dead and gone.

‚ÄúAlex‚Ä¶‚Äù I opened the house‚Äôs door before looking at her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait for me tonight, Delilah, I‚Äôll be late, and I believe that you have things to tend to in the morning‚Ä¶‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------------
Scarlett:

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù I hissed, gripping my stomach tightly as my baby kicked. I gripped on my door handle as I tried to calm my breathing down, wanting to process the pain that I was suddenly feeling.

Today was a day where my beloved little one was more than determined to make himself known. The kicks grew more intense with each passing minute, and needless to say, I knew that I didn‚Äôt have it in me to try and relax. I was due in a few weeks and the last thing I needed was to skip work or skip the one thing that would ensure our survival after I gave birth, at least, until I was back to work.

I shook my head, and taking a deep breath, I forced myself to open the door as I walked out of my apartment. I walked to work, making sure that I didn‚Äôt forget anything at home, and basically, by anything, it was a small bag of clothes if any accidents decided to occur, and something to eat if I didn‚Äôt want to eat any leftovers. The caf√© was a few blocks away from the apartment, that was something that I was grateful for, because regardless of not needing a cab, I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt afford paying for one if I wanted to, especially if my job was further away from a few blocks away.

My heart clenched, and my wolf grew more alert as another kick hit. My eyes widened in surprise and, catching sight of HIM, I felt my whole body freeze. My heart raced against my ribcage, and despite the pain of my abdomen, it seemed like I was distracted, all too distracted, to try and keep up with what was happening.

His eyes met mine, and for a second, I could swear that he frowned in confusion, probably no longer making out my features as easily as he could, or catching sight of how different I looked. I have lost more weight in the past three months to the point where my once beautiful face grew pale. My eyes had black circles under them, something that never existed, and that was due to the exhaustion that I was dealing with. Me being pregnant, studying, and going to work didn‚Äôt come out as easy as I thought it would be.

Alpha Alexander, the love of my life and my first heartbreak took a step toward me and that was when I felt like my lower half was no longer supporting me. A cry of pain escaped my mouth before I could stop it, and looking down at my feet, my heart dropped to my stomach when I saw red.

Blood.

It was MY blood.

‚ÄúScarlett‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy baby‚Äù I said, putting a hand on my stomach, my vision blurring. My eyes rolled to the back of my head, and I could vaguely hear Alexander asking for help before I felt his arms wrap around me. My heart throbbed, and my wolf whimpered, but I couldn‚Äôt care less. I felt my heart weaken, and my body go numb.

‚ÄúHold on, Scarlett, help is on the way‚Äù I heard Alexander say as he lifted me ‚ÄúI just need you to hold on‚Ä¶‚Äù

***************************************

My eyes fluttered open in a familiar room, my room.

My whole body ached, and the sound of the heart monitor only gave me a headache, and taking a few seconds to process what was going on, I found myself sitting up so quickly that my head throbbed as a headache kicked in.

‚ÄúMy baby?‚Äù I asked, looking down at my stomach, remembering the blood and what happened out in the street. Two hands were put on my shoulders, pushing me down gently, and looking up at whose hands they were, my heart raced against my chest when I saw that it was Alexander.

‚ÄúYour baby is asleep in her crib‚Äù he said, not allowing me to get up.

‚ÄúHer?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou gave birth, or more specifically, the nurses helped you give birth to a beautiful little girl‚Äù he said, his voice softening ‚Äúher body is a little weak due to you being unhealthy, but she should be fine in a few days. They have her in an incubator room that we set up for her. She‚Äôs laying in a crib that we got her, you don‚Äôt have to worry about her now, she is in safe hands‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow what, Scarlett?‚Äù Alexander asked, stopping me. His annoyance was clear in his voice, and despite the pain that I felt in my chest, I fought to stay as calm as I could so as not to show him that his words, attitude, or even presence, had an effect on me. They did, but that was the last thing that I wanted him to know of.

‚ÄúHow did you find me?‚Äù I asked, watching as he took a step back ‚Äúwhen do I get to see her‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are very lucky that I did find you when I have. You would have died if it was a ‚Äòhuman‚Äô who found you and took you to their hospital. Why the  did you choose to leave if you were pregnant, Scarlett?‚Äù He asked, glaring at me ‚Äúdo you realize how worried my parents were? And  pregnant‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou would have had me killing the baby‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI would have found out who the child‚Äôs father was and ensured that he took care of the two of you, why the  would I have asked you to kill your child?‚Äù He asked, glaring at me. My heart ached at his words, and shaking my head at him, I glared back at him.

Van and Ben also look at how Peter Dutton has decided to frame the AUKUS deal, which was started when he was Defence Minister, as a choice between funding the NDIS or building submarines.  The false choice framework is explored as are the jobs that BOTH programs are providing to workers in Australia and the need to fully fund our society.  You can join your union, whether you're a care worker or a ship builder or any kind of worker, at australianunions.org.au/wow

The New South Wales election is less than two weeks away and Van and Ben break down Perrottet's half billion dollar voucher program and contrast it against Minn's $400m commitment to ""fully fund"" public schools and ""end the war on teachers"".

Plus there is good news about the death of ""Rambo"" and Billbies!

Ben discusses how the unions in NSW that have been racking up wins across education, healthcare, transport as part of the campaign and the flow on effects for working people across the state.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

The Robodebt Royal Commission has wrapped up and despite Insiders discussing the cultural problems of the public service without mentioning that culture flows from the top, Morrison, Tudge, Porter, Stuart Robert, Ben discusses what the lack of billionaire owned media coverage says about the state of public discourse.

The RBA and Productivity Commission continue to kick working people.  Ben makes clear that Labor government's need to intervene to support working people.  That a former Liberal staffer running the Productivity Commission is unacceptable and that the RBA continues to use a broken ideology rather than economic reality to set monetary policy.

Ben reminds listeners that the FINAL Week on Wednesday LIVE at Adelaide Fringe is on THIS WEEK and the special guest will be Kyam Maher, Attorney General, Industrial Relations Minister and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who passed the first Voice to Parliament in Australia. tickets here: https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023

In this episode we chat to the 2022 Nurse Practitioner of the Year no less ‚Äì Peter Jenkin. 

Peter‚Äôs nursing career and commitment to palliative care starts well before last year‚Äôs award from the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners. 

For 11 years, and only up until recently he was a Palliative Care Nurse Practitioner for Resthaven aged care in South Australia. However, in early 2023, Peter moved to Canberra to take up a position with Calvary Health Care as a Palliative Care Nurse Practitioner working in aged care and at the ACT‚Äôs hospice, Clare Holland House.  

With aged care and health reform more broadly high on the Government's agenda, Peter has some clear advice on how Nurse Practitioners can be better utilised to deliver quality of life but is strident in his view that ‚Äúpalliative care should be everyone's business.‚Äù

,,9.03808E+14,7.07147E+14,the voice,Councillor John Stamolis,"COUNCIL DEMERGERS ‚Ä¶ A HOT STATE ELECTION ISSUE
The NSW Minister for Planning, Anthony Roberts MP has said that Council mergers have been a failure.  

Other candidates for the 2023 State election are also addressing the issue of failed Council mergers and how these mergers have been bad for their communities.  These candidates are promising to do something about it. 

In 2017, only 9 months after mergers were implemented, the Liberal Premier announced that the merger policy would be ABANDONED.  What a shame that the Premier did not also undo those 19 mergers at that time.

Many of these merged Councils have seen huge increases in Council rates.  Not only did communities get non-performing mergers that they didn‚Äôt want, they are now paying 30%-60% more in Council rates for it!

Loss of community voice, loss of representation, overwhelming bureaucracy and the enormous party-political control seen in many merged Councils has had major impact on communities and on Council performance.  

As we know in the Inner West, there is a major reason that the Labor Party is fighting against the demerger ‚Ä¶ it has delivered them full control over OUR Council.  The merger has been about what is best for the Labor Party NOT what is best for the Inner West community.  

At the poll, more people voted to demerge Inner West Council (104,219) than voted for their Councillors (104,035).   Look at the results any way you like, ALL of our 5 Council Wards in the Inner West voted to DEMERGE and ALL of our 21 suburbs in the Inner West voted to DEMERGE.  

Mergers have not and still do not deliver the promised efficiencies, savings, reduced costs and improved services.  State election candidates all over NSW have recognised this and demergers are now a key issue in this State Election.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=903807817619747

‚ÄúSir, the polls from the primaries are looking just fine. If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,‚Äù the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, ‚ÄúThen LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.‚Äù

‚ÄúLPP!‚Äù Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, ‚ÄúLiberalism to all!‚Äù

He was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.

‚ÄúYou all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,‚Äù I slapped the secretary on his back, ‚ÄúCongratulations to us all.‚Äù

Standing at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people‚Äôs party and run for the governorship of Florida.

The idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‚Äòa notorious playboy‚Äô.

Second, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn‚Äôt count as an experience.

At the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don‚Äôt know who was more shocked, myself or the public.

But somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.

When I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male‚Äôs interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6‚Äôam? Close to Nil.

It was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.

‚ÄúThis is working out.‚Äù My vice governor cheered.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.

11:30 am.

‚Äòdang!‚Äô I cursed under my breath, ‚ÄúThis meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.‚Äù I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

He addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.

The room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.

The noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.

‚ÄúIs there a problem Laura?‚Äù I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.

Her dark brows knitting, she turned to me, ‚ÄúSir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.‚Äù

I arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, ‚ÄúCan it wait till I‚Äôm done at Kota?‚Äù

She shook her head, ‚ÄúNo sir. It can‚Äôt. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, out with it.‚Äù Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.

She glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that darned organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.

Wife.

The word left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.

A wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we discuss this at the next meeting?‚Äù

Laura‚Äôs eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, ‚ÄúThe primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I thought Mr. Dakota was married?‚Äù an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.

‚ÄúIf you all don‚Äôt know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don‚Äôt know what the heck you are doing in here campaigning for him!‚Äù she snapped.

‚ÄúAs Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.‚Äù I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.

My jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.

‚ÄúPlease wait, hold the elevator.‚Äù

I lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.

My annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.

Perfect.

The single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.

All thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.

Her golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she‚Äôd look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.

Suddenly she reached for her camera.

A Reporter.

I inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I‚Äôd figured, they were nothing but trouble.

Striding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.

..............................................................................
Kimberly Scott‚Äôs P.O.V

Savage and fierce.

Devastatingly sexy.

His heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!

I snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.

Joey Dakota.

CEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People‚Äôs Party.

A hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.

How atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.

Joey Dakota is no different.

After his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics‚Äîaka stealing from the public.

It was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‚ÄòSerial heartbreaker.‚Äô

He had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.

Impulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‚Äòclicking‚Äô sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I rush at him, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing? You can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù

But he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.

That could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.

I bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, ‚ÄúHOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.‚Äù

It was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.

He removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent?  reporters.‚Äù he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a reporter. And weren‚Äôt you taught how to be courteous to strangers?‚Äù I retorted, ‚ÄúI guess not. Your mother wasn‚Äôt there to teach you manners.‚Äù

I watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ‚ÄòOh dang!‚Äô I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.

I quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‚ÄòDing‚Äô and I felt my heart plop into my belly.

He turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù

His voice could cut glass.

Celebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything‚Ä¶maybe ‚Ä¶. Murder?

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.

I slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me‚Äîa good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.

A cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.

The slap never came.

Cracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, ‚ÄúYou thought I was going to hit you?‚Äù his voice was quiet. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

I held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.

I stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn‚Äôt tell him or anyone at all.

I was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.

I shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.

‚ÄúI would never hit a woman,‚Äù he mused softly, ‚ÄúI only broke the stupid storage card.‚Äù

‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?‚Äù I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.

Angry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.

That card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.

An image of a woman‚Äôs pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.

It was my only hope in paying for my mother‚Äôs hospital bills.

One would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.

Life had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.

Neither of us expected the stage four bare cancer that took over my mother‚Äôs previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.

She got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.

I rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.

Just as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.

My knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.

I felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.

His arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn‚Äôt be this trembling mess in his arms.

‚ÄúHey, Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I could hear the blood passing through my ears‚Äîthump, thump, thump‚Äîand saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.

I fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.

‚ÄúAre you claustrophobic?‚Äù now that he wasn‚Äôt holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.

I nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn‚Äôt see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since‚Ä¶ I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.

I fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.

Suddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, ‚ÄúYou are having a panic attack Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and I croaked, ‚ÄúKim... Call me Kim.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need you to focus on the sound of my voice,‚Äù His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.

‚ÄúBreath Kim,‚Äù he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.

I tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.

‚ÄúYou are dying.‚Äù A voice in my head said, ‚ÄúThis was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.‚Äù

As if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, ‚ÄúYou are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim‚Ä¶Breath.‚Äù

His voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.

My palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.

I felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, ‚ÄúWe are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.‚Äù

My breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.

Soon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of the one-sided conversation.

He shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, ‚Äúis it better now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.

Now that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn‚Äôt matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.

Suddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.

My eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.

dang!

..............................................................................
Joey‚Äôs P.O.V

Why the screw did they come here?

I jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.

As if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.

The doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.

 reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn‚Äôt felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.

A ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.

I‚Äôm surprised the spit-fire hasn‚Äôt threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I‚Äôve been staring at her.

The elevator doors pinged.

The top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.

Waving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim‚Äôs hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.‚Äù

She shook her head, ‚ÄúGive me one reason I shouldn‚Äôt head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!‚Äù

Taken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou destroyed my  storage card.‚Äù Her eyes shone, ‚ÄúIt had everything in it. Everything!‚Äù

She enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.

‚ÄúWe are kind of in the middle of something,‚Äù I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.

Thankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.

Laurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.

‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt brief me that a conference might be held.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.‚Äù

What?

Somehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.

Their voices yelled over each other.

Clearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, ‚ÄúAs you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.‚Äù His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.

I felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.

Clearly, this wasn‚Äôt her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since‚Ä¶I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.

‚ÄúLet me take it from here,‚Äù I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.

All eyes riveted on me, ‚ÄúAs Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,‚Äù there was a low chorus of laughter, ‚Äúand there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Came from the throng.

Tightening my hold on Kim‚Äôs trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.

Ripping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.‚Äù Her voice was breathless.

A smile tipped the side of my face, ‚ÄúIt gets better with time.‚Äù

She snapped her head up and glared at me, ‚ÄúHow does THAT get any better?‚Äù her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.

I walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.

I handed her one and took a sip from mine, ‚ÄúBecause you get used to it.‚Äù

She gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.

A hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank  God.

I just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.

My jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I  missed the meeting.

Suddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.

She jolted as she saw me standing by the door, ‚ÄúSir? I thought you left.‚Äù

I shook my head, ‚ÄúThe elevator broke down.‚Äù

It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.

She nodded slowly in understanding.

‚ÄúYou had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I‚Äôd lose that one.‚Äù She glanced at a note in her hand.

I scowled, staring down at my ex-wife‚Äôs name scribbled on the paper, ‚ÄúAnything important?

‚ÄúThe usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.‚Äù

I crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.

Then changing the topic, she pointed at the door, ‚ÄúThey finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured distractedly.

I reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, ‚ÄúKimberly Scott?‚Äù

I had momentarily forgotten that I wasn‚Äôt alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura‚Äôs wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim replied hesitantly, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, ‚ÄúI am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.‚Äù

Legend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?

A loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.

‚ÄúYou must give me an autograph,‚Äù Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, ‚ÄúThis is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.‚Äù

The latter it is then.

Kim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.

A few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‚ÄòI hadn‚Äôt been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.

She took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?‚Äù

She nodded, somewhat embarrassed, ‚ÄúOf course, you can.‚Äù

Laura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, ‚ÄúUh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.‚Äù

She was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.

Helping her out of her misery, I cut in, ‚ÄúYou never told me you were such a big shot,‚Äù I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.

But her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, ‚ÄúYeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‚Äòbig shot.‚Äô Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt hear a word she said.

Her eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, ‚ÄúDo you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?‚Äù I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.

Our eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.

Laura immediately chipped in, ‚ÄúKim, you haven‚Äôt published a photo since the last one. Why‚Ä¶?‚Äù she trailed off.

Kim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, ‚ÄúI have other things taking my time now.‚Äù Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.

At her exit, Laura sighed, ‚Äúyou must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‚Äòan angel.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did the media term me as, ‚ÄúDevil?‚Äù I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúThey would be right if they did.‚Äù

I snorted.

Suddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Narrowing my eyes, I asked, ‚ÄúI know that look, Laura.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I might know what we have to do to get you a bride before the primaries.‚Äù

Among many initiatives, Sarah has organised rallies attended by thousands of people, campaigned for anti-drink spiking measures, created support kits for sexual assault survivors, organised safe spaces at major events, and provides in-person support to people in the immediate aftermath of their assault.

As well as working to eliminate sexual assault and domestic violence, Sarah wants to help survivors use their voice and demonstrate that it is okay to speak out.

There wasn't just one nomination that came in for Sarah, there were several, which really demonstrates the impact she has had on our community.

This is a hard post to write because, let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî sometimes being a women is a genuine challenge. It can be hard to get recognition for the gazillion things we juggle each day, and the millions of tiny acts of care we display for the people close to us. Self care can take a backseat when there are so many people around us relying on us to be the strong one in their lives.

It‚Äôs hard to be seen as strong when our strength so often lies under the surface. It can be hard for people to recognise our strength when so often it‚Äôs invisible. And women ARE strong. Yes, all of us. 

So this International Women‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôd like you to consider celebrating other women who just as empowered as you are. And I‚Äôd like you to consider stepping back for a second and recognising your own strength. Because it‚Äôs there, whether you pause long enough to recognise it or not. 

If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôd like you to remember your worth ‚Äî as a woman and as a contributing member of society. 

I‚Äôd encourage you to tell other women you know that you see them, and you see their strength shining through.

And I‚Äôd like you to consider how strong you personally are. How you‚Äôve made it through 100% of your toughest days on this planet and you‚Äôre still going. 

Celebrate your inner strength, and celebrate the strength of the women around you. 

We all deserve recognition, and if your recognition comes from within, it‚Äôs just as valid. 

Be the voice of reason you craved when you were younger. And be the voice for the next generation too, if you ever get the privilege. 

Hold onto your strength and draw upon it when you need it the most. 

Even if no one but you knows your personal journey, keep going. Travel through this life of ours, and remember: you are worth it. You‚Äôre worth the time. You‚Äôre worth the recognition. You‚Äôre worth the acceptance. And you‚Äôre worth celebrating your own story.

You are a woman. It‚Äôs time for you to shine ‚Äî today, and always.

Van and Ben discuss the socialist foundations of International Women's Day, the struggles that are still to be won and Van's view of why being a woman shouldn't be an ""economic class"" but has been made one by men in grey suits.

Whatever industry you‚Äôre in you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

The outrageous ""bro"" behaviour of Elon Musk is brought into focus as he picks a fight with a hero of the Icelandic people.  Van and Ben explore how ego made a man who paid $44 Billion for Twitter ended up having to admit on Twitter that Twitter is not great for ""communication.  

As the Australian people wrestle with inflation, driven by profiteering, the RBA governor has admitted that the record increases in interest rates are being driven by ""the vibe"" of their ""business liaison"" rather than the stats of the ABS.  Van and Ben pull apart what the latest rate rise might mean and how it could impact working people.

And the good news is about a new deal for the world's oceans.

‚ÄúSir, the polls from the primaries are looking just fine. If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,‚Äù the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, ‚ÄúThen LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.‚Äù

‚ÄúLPP!‚Äù Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, ‚ÄúLiberalism to all!‚Äù

He was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.

‚ÄúYou all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,‚Äù I slapped the secretary on his back, ‚ÄúCongratulations to us all.‚Äù

Standing at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people‚Äôs party and run for the governorship of Florida.

The idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‚Äòa notorious playboy‚Äô.

Second, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn‚Äôt count as an experience.

At the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don‚Äôt know who was more shocked, myself or the public.

But somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.

When I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male‚Äôs interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6‚Äôam? Close to Nil.

It was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.

‚ÄúThis is working out.‚Äù My vice governor cheered.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.

11:30 am.

‚Äò‚Äô I cursed under my breath, ‚ÄúThis meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.‚Äù I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

He addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.

The room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.

The noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.

‚ÄúIs there a problem Laura?‚Äù I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.

Her dark brows knitting, she turned to me, ‚ÄúSir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.‚Äù

I arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, ‚ÄúCan it wait till I‚Äôm done at Kota?‚Äù

She shook her head, ‚ÄúNo sir. It can‚Äôt. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, out with it.‚Äù Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.

She glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.

Wife.

The word left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.

A wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we discuss this at the next meeting?‚Äù

Laura‚Äôs eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, ‚ÄúThe primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I thought Mr. Dakota was married?‚Äù an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.

‚ÄúIf you all don‚Äôt know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don‚Äôt know what the hell you are doing in here campaigning for him!‚Äù she snapped.

‚ÄúAs Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.‚Äù I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.

My jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.

‚ÄúPlease wait, hold the elevator.‚Äù

I lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.

My annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.

Perfect.

The single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.

All thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.

Her golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she‚Äôd look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.

Suddenly she reached for her camera.

A Reporter.

I inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I‚Äôd figured, they were nothing but trouble.

Striding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.

..............................................................................
Kimberly Scott‚Äôs P.O.V

Savage and fierce.

Devastatingly sexy.

His heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!

I snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.

Joey Dakota.

CEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People‚Äôs Party.

A hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.

How atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.

Joey Dakota is no different.

After his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics‚Äîaka stealing from the public.

It was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‚ÄòSerial heartbreaker.‚Äô

He had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.

Impulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‚Äòclicking‚Äô sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I rush at him, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing? You can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù

But he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.

That could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.

I bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, ‚ÄúHOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.‚Äù

It was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.

He removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent? F* reporters.‚Äù he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a reporter. And weren‚Äôt you taught how to be courteous to strangers?‚Äù I retorted, ‚ÄúI guess not. Your mother wasn‚Äôt there to teach you manners.‚Äù

I watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ‚Äô I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.

I quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‚ÄòDing‚Äô and I felt my heart plop into my belly.

He turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù

His voice could cut glass.

Celebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything‚Ä¶maybe ‚Ä¶. Murder?

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.

I slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me‚Äîa good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.

A cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.

The slap never came.

Cracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, ‚ÄúYou thought I was going to hit you?‚Äù his voice was quiet. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

I held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.

I stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn‚Äôt tell him or anyone at all.

I was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.

I shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.

‚ÄúI would never hit a woman,‚Äù he mused softly, ‚ÄúI only broke the stupid storage card.‚Äù

‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?‚Äù I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.

Angry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.

That card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.

An image of a woman‚Äôs pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.

It was my only hope in paying for my mother‚Äôs hospital bills.

One would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.

Life had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.

Neither of us expected the stage four breast cancer that took over my mother‚Äôs previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.

She got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.

I rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.

Just as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.

My knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.

I felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.

His arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn‚Äôt be this trembling mess in his arms.

‚ÄúHey, Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I could hear the blood passing through my ears‚Äîthump, thump, thump‚Äîand saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.

I fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.

‚ÄúAre you claustrophobic?‚Äù now that he wasn‚Äôt holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.

I nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn‚Äôt see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since‚Ä¶ I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.

I fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.

Suddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, ‚ÄúYou are having a panic attack Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and I croaked, ‚ÄúKim... Call me Kim.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need you to focus on the sound of my voice,‚Äù His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.

‚ÄúBreath Kim,‚Äù he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.

I tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.

‚ÄúYou are dying.‚Äù A voice in my head said, ‚ÄúThis was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.‚Äù

As if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, ‚ÄúYou are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim‚Ä¶Breath.‚Äù

His voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.

My palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.

I felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, ‚ÄúWe are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.‚Äù

My breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.

Soon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of the one-sided conversation.

He shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, ‚Äúis it better now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.

Now that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn‚Äôt matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.

Suddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.

My eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.

..............................................................................
Joey‚Äôs P.O.V

Why the* did they come here?

I jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.

As if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.

The doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.

*ing reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn‚Äôt felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.

A ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.

I‚Äôm surprised the spit-fire hasn‚Äôt threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I‚Äôve been staring at her.

The elevator doors pinged.

The top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.

Waving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim‚Äôs hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.‚Äù

She shook her head, ‚ÄúGive me one reason I shouldn‚Äôt head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!‚Äù

Taken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou destroyed my* storage card.‚Äù Her eyes shone, ‚ÄúIt had everything in it. Everything!‚Äù

She enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.

‚ÄúWe are kind of in the middle of something,‚Äù I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.

Thankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.

Laurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.

‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt brief me that a conference might be held.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.‚Äù

What?

Somehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.

Their voices yelled over each other.

Clearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, ‚ÄúAs you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.‚Äù His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.

I felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.

Clearly, this wasn‚Äôt her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since‚Ä¶I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.

‚ÄúLet me take it from here,‚Äù I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.

All eyes riveted on me, ‚ÄúAs Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,‚Äù there was a low chorus of laughter, ‚Äúand there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Came from the throng.

Tightening my hold on Kim‚Äôs trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.

Ripping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.‚Äù Her voice was breathless.

A smile tipped the side of my face, ‚ÄúIt gets better with time.‚Äù

She snapped her head up and glared at me, ‚ÄúHow does THAT get any better?‚Äù her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.

I walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.

I handed her one and took a sip from mine, ‚ÄúBecause you get used to it.‚Äù

She gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.

A hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank*g God.

I just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.

My jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I * missed the meeting.

Suddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.

She jolted as she saw me standing by the door, ‚ÄúSir? I thought you left.‚Äù

I shook my head, ‚ÄúThe elevator broke down.‚Äù

It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.

She nodded slowly in understanding.

‚ÄúYou had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I‚Äôd lose that one.‚Äù She glanced at a note in her hand.

I scowled, staring down at my ex-wife‚Äôs name scribbled on the paper, ‚ÄúAnything important?

‚ÄúThe usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.‚Äù

I crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.

Then changing the topic, she pointed at the door, ‚ÄúThey finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured distractedly.

I reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, ‚ÄúKimberly Scott?‚Äù

I had momentarily forgotten that I wasn‚Äôt alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura‚Äôs wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim replied hesitantly, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, ‚ÄúI am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.‚Äù

Legend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?

A loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.

‚ÄúYou must give me an autograph,‚Äù Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, ‚ÄúThis is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.‚Äù

The latter it is then.

Kim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.

A few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‚ÄòI hadn‚Äôt been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.

She took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?‚Äù

She nodded, somewhat embarrassed, ‚ÄúOf course, you can.‚Äù

Laura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, ‚ÄúUh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.‚Äù

She was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.

Helping her out of her misery, I cut in, ‚ÄúYou never told me you were such a big shot,‚Äù I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.

But her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, ‚ÄúYeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‚Äòbig shot.‚Äô Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt hear a word she said.

Her eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, ‚ÄúDo you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?‚Äù I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.

Our eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.

Laura immediately chipped in, ‚ÄúKim, you haven‚Äôt published a photo since the last one. Why‚Ä¶?‚Äù she trailed off.

Kim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, ‚ÄúI have other things taking my time now.‚Äù Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.

At her exit, Laura sighed, ‚Äúyou must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‚Äòan angel.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did the media term me as, ‚ÄúDevil?‚Äù I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúThey would be right if they did.‚Äù

I snorted.

Suddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Narrowing my eyes, I asked, ‚ÄúI know that look, Laura.‚Äù",['Click to Read more aboutüìú<AGAINST HER WILL>üìú'],['www.readfreeapp.com'],,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=208604435090299

,,1.15878E+15,1.01966E+14,the voice,CatcatNovel,"Joey Dakota‚Äôs P.O.V

‚ÄúSir, the polls from the primaries are looking just fine. If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,‚Äù the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, ‚ÄúThen LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.‚Äù

‚ÄúLPP!‚Äù Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, ‚ÄúLiberalism to all!‚Äù

He was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.

‚ÄúYou all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,‚Äù I slapped the secretary on his back, ‚ÄúCongratulations to us all.‚Äù

Standing at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people‚Äôs party and run for the governorship of Florida.

The idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‚Äòa notorious playboy‚Äô.

Second, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn‚Äôt count as an experience.

At the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don‚Äôt know who was more shocked, myself or the public.

But somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.

When I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male‚Äôs interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6‚Äôam? Close to Nil.

It was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.

‚ÄúThis is working out.‚Äù My vice governor cheered.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.

11:30 am.

‚Äò‚Äô I cursed under my breath, ‚ÄúThis meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.‚Äù I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

He addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.

The room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.

The noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.

‚ÄúIs there a problem Laura?‚Äù I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.

Her dark brows knitting, she turned to me, ‚ÄúSir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.‚Äù

I arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, ‚ÄúCan it wait till I‚Äôm done at Kota?‚Äù

She shook her head, ‚ÄúNo sir. It can‚Äôt. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, out with it.‚Äù Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.

She glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.

Wife.

The word left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.

A wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we discuss this at the next meeting?‚Äù

Laura‚Äôs eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, ‚ÄúThe primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I thought Mr. Dakota was married?‚Äù an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.

‚ÄúIf you all don‚Äôt know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don‚Äôt know what the hell you are doing in here campaigning for him!‚Äù she snapped.

‚ÄúAs Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.‚Äù I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.

My jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.

‚ÄúPlease wait, hold the elevator.‚Äù

I lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.

My annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.

Perfect.

The single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.

All thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.

Her golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she‚Äôd look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.

Suddenly she reached for her camera.

A Reporter.

I inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I‚Äôd figured, they were nothing but trouble.

Striding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.

..............................................................................
Kimberly Scott‚Äôs P.O.V

Savage and fierce.

Devastatingly sexy.

His heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!

I snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.

Joey Dakota.

CEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People‚Äôs Party.

A hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.

How atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.

Joey Dakota is no different.

After his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics‚Äîaka stealing from the public.

It was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‚ÄòSerial heartbreaker.‚Äô

He had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.

Impulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‚Äòclicking‚Äô sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I rush at him, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing? You can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù

But he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.

That could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.

I bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, ‚ÄúHOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.‚Äù

It was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.

He removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent? F* reporters.‚Äù he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a reporter. And weren‚Äôt you taught how to be courteous to strangers?‚Äù I retorted, ‚ÄúI guess not. Your mother wasn‚Äôt there to teach you manners.‚Äù

I watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ‚Äô I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.

I quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‚ÄòDing‚Äô and I felt my heart plop into my belly.

He turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù

His voice could cut glass.

Celebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything‚Ä¶maybe ‚Ä¶. Murder?

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.

I slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me‚Äîa good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.

A cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.

The slap never came.

Cracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, ‚ÄúYou thought I was going to hit you?‚Äù his voice was quiet. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

I held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.

I stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn‚Äôt tell him or anyone at all.

I was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.

I shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.

‚ÄúI would never hit a woman,‚Äù he mused softly, ‚ÄúI only broke the stupid storage card.‚Äù

‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?‚Äù I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.

Angry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.

That card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.

An image of a woman‚Äôs pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.

It was my only hope in paying for my mother‚Äôs hospital bills.

One would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.

Life had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.

Neither of us expected the stage four breast cancer that took over my mother‚Äôs previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.

She got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.

I rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.

Just as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.

My knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.

I felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.

His arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn‚Äôt be this trembling mess in his arms.

‚ÄúHey, Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I could hear the blood passing through my ears‚Äîthump, thump, thump‚Äîand saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.

I fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.

‚ÄúAre you claustrophobic?‚Äù now that he wasn‚Äôt holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.

I nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn‚Äôt see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since‚Ä¶ I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.

I fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.

Suddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, ‚ÄúYou are having a panic attack Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and I croaked, ‚ÄúKim... Call me Kim.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need you to focus on the sound of my voice,‚Äù His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.

‚ÄúBreath Kim,‚Äù he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.

I tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.

‚ÄúYou are dying.‚Äù A voice in my head said, ‚ÄúThis was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.‚Äù

As if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, ‚ÄúYou are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim‚Ä¶Breath.‚Äù

His voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.

My palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.

I felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, ‚ÄúWe are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.‚Äù

My breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.

Soon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of the one-sided conversation.

He shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, ‚Äúis it better now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.

Now that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn‚Äôt matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.

Suddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.

My eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.

..............................................................................
Joey‚Äôs P.O.V

Why the* did they come here?

I jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.

As if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.

The doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.

*ing reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn‚Äôt felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.

A ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.

I‚Äôm surprised the spit-fire hasn‚Äôt threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I‚Äôve been staring at her.

The elevator doors pinged.

The top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.

Waving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim‚Äôs hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.‚Äù

She shook her head, ‚ÄúGive me one reason I shouldn‚Äôt head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!‚Äù

Taken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou destroyed my* storage card.‚Äù Her eyes shone, ‚ÄúIt had everything in it. Everything!‚Äù

She enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.

‚ÄúWe are kind of in the middle of something,‚Äù I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.

Thankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.

Laurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.

‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt brief me that a conference might be held.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.‚Äù

What?

Somehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.

Their voices yelled over each other.

Clearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, ‚ÄúAs you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.‚Äù His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.

I felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.

Clearly, this wasn‚Äôt her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since‚Ä¶I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.

‚ÄúLet me take it from here,‚Äù I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.

All eyes riveted on me, ‚ÄúAs Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,‚Äù there was a low chorus of laughter, ‚Äúand there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Came from the throng.

Tightening my hold on Kim‚Äôs trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.

Ripping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.‚Äù Her voice was breathless.

A smile tipped the side of my face, ‚ÄúIt gets better with time.‚Äù

She snapped her head up and glared at me, ‚ÄúHow does THAT get any better?‚Äù her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.

I walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.

I handed her one and took a sip from mine, ‚ÄúBecause you get used to it.‚Äù

She gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.

A hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank*g God.

I just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.

My jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I * missed the meeting.

Suddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.

She jolted as she saw me standing by the door, ‚ÄúSir? I thought you left.‚Äù

I shook my head, ‚ÄúThe elevator broke down.‚Äù

It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.

She nodded slowly in understanding.

‚ÄúYou had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I‚Äôd lose that one.‚Äù She glanced at a note in her hand.

I scowled, staring down at my ex-wife‚Äôs name scribbled on the paper, ‚ÄúAnything important?

‚ÄúThe usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.‚Äù

I crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.

Then changing the topic, she pointed at the door, ‚ÄúThey finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured distractedly.

I reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, ‚ÄúKimberly Scott?‚Äù

I had momentarily forgotten that I wasn‚Äôt alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura‚Äôs wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim replied hesitantly, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, ‚ÄúI am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.‚Äù

Legend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?

A loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.

‚ÄúYou must give me an autograph,‚Äù Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, ‚ÄúThis is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.‚Äù

The latter it is then.

Kim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.

A few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‚ÄòI hadn‚Äôt been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.

She took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?‚Äù

She nodded, somewhat embarrassed, ‚ÄúOf course, you can.‚Äù

Laura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, ‚ÄúUh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.‚Äù

She was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.

Helping her out of her misery, I cut in, ‚ÄúYou never told me you were such a big shot,‚Äù I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.

But her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, ‚ÄúYeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‚Äòbig shot.‚Äô Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt hear a word she said.

Her eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, ‚ÄúDo you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?‚Äù I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.

Our eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.

Laura immediately chipped in, ‚ÄúKim, you haven‚Äôt published a photo since the last one. Why‚Ä¶?‚Äù she trailed off.

Kim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, ‚ÄúI have other things taking my time now.‚Äù Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.

At her exit, Laura sighed, ‚Äúyou must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‚Äòan angel.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did the media term me as, ‚ÄúDevil?‚Äù I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúThey would be right if they did.‚Äù

I snorted.

Suddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Narrowing my eyes, I asked, ‚ÄúI know that look, Laura.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I might know what we have to do to get you a bride before the primaries.‚Äù",['Click to Read more aboutüìú<AGAINST HER WILL>üìú'],['www.readfreeapp.com'],,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=1158779101456960

""Then abort it!"" said Michael without hesitation. ""You're not fit to bear my child."" With that, he turned around and left.
Chapter 1: Wendy Stewart, Let's Get A Divorce!
""Wendy Stewart, let's get a divorce!""
These words were not unfamiliar to Wendy Stewart.
Yet, no matter how many times she heard those words, they still made her heart ache painfully.
Without hesitation, she rose and walked over to support the drunken man. But before her hands could touch Michael Lucas, he pushed her away cruelly.
""Don't touch me!"" Michael's cold voice was filled with contemptuous rejection.
Wendy stumbled backward. Her collision with the edge of the table halted her momentum.
Michael approached her. He reached out, wrapping his hand around Wendy's neck. With a dark smile, he asked, ""Do you agree to this divorce?""
Wendy found it difficult to talk when she was being strangled. She managed to choke out, ""I... do not.""
""You do not?"" Michael's smile grew even colder as he tightened his grip around her neck.
Following that action, he pushed Wendy onto the table and informed her coldly, ""In that case, you have to fulfill your obligation to me as my wife ...""
Wendy gripped the edges of the table forcefully and could only passively put up with everything that was happening.
After some time, Michael finally decided to spare her.
He walked over to the edge of the bed, pulled open the bedside drawer, and took out a pill. Tossing it onto Wendy's body, he instructed her in his usual icy cold tone, ""Swallow it.""
The pill first landed on Wendy's body before falling onto the ground.
She gazed at the pill lying on the floor. Lowering her head, Wendy squatted down and picked it up slowly.
Picking up the pill, Wendy hesitated for a moment before putting it in her mouth.
Michael left after watching Wendy consume the pill.
Wendy waited until Michael had completely disappeared from her vision before she spat out the pill in her mouth.
Staring at the tiny pill, Wendy laughed bitterly, and then she started to cry quietly.
She had never dared to cry in front of Michael.
After all, Michael had once told her that he hated it when she cried, that he hated looking at her sad face.
The following day, Wendy went to work at MC Enterprise on time as if nothing happened.
MC Enterprise was the biggest company in Lake City and Michael Lucas was the president there. Wendy happened to be his personal assistant.
Michael's cold voice drifted to her ears the moment she entered the president's office.
He said, ""This is the third time that you are late this month. Your bonus salary has been completely deducted.""
Wendy bowed her head slightly and replied, ""In that case, you can dock my pay.""
The truth was that Wendy had not arrived late at all. This was just Michael looking for an excuse to deduct her pay.
Without raising his head, Michael said, ""You can quit if you have any opinions about it.""
""I don't have any opinions,"" replied Wendy as she blinked. ""Let me prepare some coffee for you.""
After preparing the coffee, Wendy served it to Michael.
She had just reached his office door when she heard Yvonne's voice.
Yvonne Taylor was the woman that Michael had loved for four years. Because of Yvonne, Wendy had been reduced to a cunning and unscrupulous woman in Michael's eyes.
Michael had once warned Wendy that the only thing he could give her was a marriage certificate. The only reason she was able to join his company was because of pressure from his grandmother.
She was instructed to avoid Yvonne whenever that woman appeared at the company. The consequence for not adhering to that was Wendy's departure from MC Enterprise.
Wendy was afraid to disobey.
Just as Wendy was about to head to the lounge to avoid Yvonne, she heard the latter say, ""Michael, you've finally agreed to let me join the company as your assistant. I'm overjoyed.""
Wendy heard Michael acknowledge those words.
This made Wendy instantly stop in her tracks. Her hands, which were wrapped around the cup of coffee, started trembling.
Wendy entered the office and grew agitated before Michael, which was a rare occurrence. ""I don't approve of that!"" she said.
Michael shot Wendy a disgruntled look, replying in a cold voice, ""What right do you have to disagree?""
Wendy said, ""Michael, you promised me.""
""I did promise you, but it's been three years. Some things should have changed a long time ago,"" replied Michael coldly. ""You don't get any say in the company's affairs.""
""Grandmother would never agree to it. Aren't you afraid of angering her?"" For Wendy, Michael's grandmother was the only bargaining chip she possessed.
When Michael heard those words, his face instantly darkened. ""Wendy Stewart, you keep dragging my grandmother into the picture. Haven't you had enough? Let me warn you, don't try to use my grandmother to pressure me. If you feel as though you can't stay in this company, the HR department is on the fifth story.""
This was Michael's ultimate weapon. No matter what happened, if Michael threatened her with divorce or resignation, Wendy found herself unable to do anything except grit her teeth and put up with it all.
***
News of Yvonne Taylor's new position of assistant to the president of MC Enterprise spread like wildfire throughout the company that very afternoon.
It was well known within the company that Yvonne was Michael's girlfriend.
Initially, Michael wanted to arrange for Yvonne to have a separate office. However, Yvonne claimed that she was coming here to work and said that it was best if they followed the company's rules.
Consequently, it was only natural that Yvonne and Wendy started sharing the same office space.
Yvonne approached Wendy with a smile. She said, ""Wendy Stewart, you resorted to despicable means to steal Michael from me three years ago and plotted to get married to him.""
""But how are things going for you now?""
""The entire company, no, in fact, everyone in Lake City knows that I am his real girlfriend.""
""If you're smart, you should leave Michael of your own accord.""
""Otherwise, don't blame me for being nasty.""
""This is the president's work schedule for this week. I've already flagged out the important clients for you. Since you're now his assistant, you should do what you need to do."" Wendy handed Yvonne a document and continued, ""The first thing you should do upon arriving at the company every morning is to make a cup of coffee for the president. President Lucas likes his coffee without sugar, and you have to personally grind the coffee beans ...""
Wendy had not finished speaking when Yvonne slapped away the document she was holding. Yvonne retracted her smile.
Her voice filled with hatred as she said, ""Why are you so shameless? Michael does not love you at all, but you insist on clinging to him. Do you know that Michael always tells me how disgusted he feels when he sees you? I really don't know how your parents raised you. You are just a vixen who specializes in stealing other people's boyfriends!""
""Yvonne Taylor!"" Wendy stood up abruptly, slamming her hand heavily against the table. ""We both know very well exactly what happened three years ago.""
""So what if we know very well?"" Yvonne sneered. ""I'm sure you've tried to explain yourself to Michael many times over the past three years. If he wanted to believe you, it would have worked long ago.""
""Stop daydreaming! I am the person Michael loves. In his heart, you are just a vicious woman. See, I wanted to join the company and all had to do was tell him about it. He let me come to work the following day. You should know better than anyone where I stand in his heart. If you are smart, you should leave before it's too late. Otherwise, I'll make sure you meet with a horrible end!""
""Is that so? In that case, let's just wait and see what happens,"" replied Wendy. She had endured everything for the past three years without getting divorced, there was no way that she would just back off just because Yvonne joined the company.
Suddenly, Yvonne shrieked and fell to the ground. Her tone immediately grew indignant as she said, ""Miss Stewart, I know you don't like me and you never wanted me to join the company. However, all I wanted to do was stay by Michael's side and help him alleviate some of his work problems ... I know you guys are married and I should not be doing this. But your marriage was a mistake in the first place, it was you who ... who ..."" Yvonne burst into tears.
Wendy did not have to turn back to guess that Michael had probably stepped into the room.
Indeed, Michael took big strides forward. He squatted to help Yvonne up. His face was filled with anger as he gazed at Wendy. ""You should know that there is a limit to my tolerance.""
""Michael, please don't blame Miss Stewart. She just wanted to chase me away. She doesn't want me here,"" said Yvonne as she leaned heavily on Michael as if she had no backbone and was incapable of standing on her own.
Wendy clenched her fists hidden beneath her sleeves.
""There is a CCTV in this office. You can look at the footage to see for yourself what really happened earlier.""
Wendy knew Michael would never believe her words. The CCTV footage was the only way to let Michael learn about the truth.
Upon hearing those words, Yvonne's eyes flashed, and she started crying harder.
""Michael, I just wanted to work peacefully with Miss Stewart. After all, we are both your assistants. All I did was ask her about some work-related questions and requested for her guidance ... However, instead of helping me, she slapped my face with a document, and even pushed me ...""
Yvonne's crying had reached its peak.
Michael comforted her while lecturing Wendy, ""If you dare bully Yvonne again, I'll sure to teach you a lesson that even grandmother cannot interfere in.""
""Haha ..."" Wendy chuckled bitterly.
Indeed, Michael did not even want to check the CCTV footage.
He believed everything Yvonne said.
Chapter 2: Wake Up! Michael Doesn't Love You
Yvonne joined the company as Michael's personal assistant but she had no actual responsibilities. All she did every day was wandering around the company, win over the hearts of her colleagues, and when it was time, have lunch with Michael.
Just as Michael had told her, all Yvonne had to do was look as pretty as a flower.
Of course, Yvonne also plotted to get Wendy in trouble.
The only thing Wendy could do was put up with it.
In the afternoon, Michael personally entered their office.
""Michael."" Upon seeing Michael, Yvonne instantly greeted him with a smile. ""Are you done with your meeting?""
""Yes, I am. I'm here to have lunch with you,"" Michael replied with a smile on his face. His arm wrapped around Yvonne's waist smoothly. He completely ignored Wendy's existence and led Yvonne past her, exiting the room.
Wendy's gaze trailed after their interlocked hands, her eyes unblinking.
Nobody knew just how much misery she felt in her heart whenever Michael and Yvonne put up such a public display of affection in front of her.
Wendy clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her skin. However, she felt nothing but numbness.
Inhaling a deep breath, Wendy regulated her own emotions. She comforted herself quietly. After all, this was not the first time. What was the point of getting angry now?
She thought, 'if I cannot even put up with this, how can I continue working in this company?'
As Wendy lowered her head to arrange the documents on the table, she caught sight of fresh blood dripping from her palms. Almost mechanically, she grabbed a piece of tissue to clean her wounds.
Not long after, Zen Tanner entered the office. He said, ""Wendy, I just found out that President Lucas deducted money from your salary again. Why didn't you tell me that you have no money to eat? Come on, let's go get some food.""
""I'm not hungry, and anyway, I'm trying to lose weight. I don't want to eat. You can go ahead,"" said Wendy. The truth was, she was afraid of running into Yvonne and Michael at the cafeteria in the third story.
""Don't tell me you're not hungry again. You haven't been eating lunch for the past few days, have you? Aren't you afraid you'll end up starving your body? If that really happens, you'll just be letting Yvonne win."" Zen paid no attention to Wendy's rejection. He grabbed her and walked out of the office.
Wendy had no appetite, to begin with. However, Zen was right. She thought, 'if l really fall sick from starving myself, I would be letting Yvonne win.'
She followed Zen to the third story.
Halfway through their meal, Michael and Yvonne walked out of the private room.
Wendy heard the people around her express their envy, but she did not have the courage to look up at the couple.
When Yvonne saw Wendy, her eyes flashed.
Releasing her grip on Michael, she approached Wendy with a smile. Yvonne took out a bracelet from her purse and handed it to her, saying, ""Miss Stewart, I have a gift for you ... I wanted to give this to you previously as well, but you refused to accept it. This time, I hope that you will accept it in front of everybody. In the future, let's work hard together and help Michael, okay?""
Yvonne had never tried to give Wendy any gifts. Her words were only meant for the people around them to hear, to highlight her generosity and Wendy's pettiness.
""I don't need it,"" Wendy rejected her coldly.
She thought, 'why would I possibly accept anything from Yvonne?'
When she looked up, she saw delight swimming in Yvonne's eyes.
Indeed, everyone around them was talking about her.
Someone said, ""Wendy Stewart really doesn't know where she stands.""
Another person added, ""How dare she act so arrogant when Miss Taylor is personally offering her a gift?""
""Miss Taylor is the president's real girlfriend. Where does Wendy get her guts from? really respect her.""
""Indeed, the whole company knows what she's up to. I really don't know how such a shameless woman can exist in this world.""
""I heard that Wendy Stewart threatened Yvonne Taylor on her first day here. I really don't know where she got the courage to act like that.""
....
""Miss Stewart, are you saying you don't want to work harmoniously with me?""
Yvonne's tone quickly turned indignant. She continued, ""I know that you detest me, but I just want to do my job well.""
Wendy thought, 'she wants to do her job well?'
She wanted to laugh.
Has Yvonne even done anything at all over the past few days?
Yvonne schemed endlessly to enter the company, all because she wanted to always remain at Michael's side.
Just like ... Wendy herself.
Wendy did not have a good reputation in the company. She did not care and could not be bothered to explain herself.
Lowering her head, Wendy continued eating the rice in her bowl.
Zen could not continue watching this. He stood up. But before he could say anything, he was held back by Wendy. ""It's not necessary,"" she said.
Wendy knew that Zen was doing this for her good.
However, she worked at MC Enterprise where Michael was the president of the company. On top of that, Yvonne had gotten a job as his assistant. If Zen tried to stand up for Wendy right now, even if he did not get fired immediately, he would have a hard time in the company.
As Michael observed Wendy's indifference, anger rose in his chest.
He thought that this woman really did not know any better.
Michael stepped forward. He took the bracelet on the table and turned around, pulling Yvonne with him. In a cold voice, he said, ""She's not worthy of such an expensive gift.""
Yvonne turned her head to glance at Wendy and made sure she was loud enough to be overheard by the latter when she spoke, ""I know I shouldn't give away the bracelet that you bought for me, Michael, but I really had nothing but good intentions. I just want to remain in the company and be able to stay by your side.""
Hold on ...
Wendy thought, 'that bracelet was a gift from Michael?'
Wendy inhaled deeply.
In the past three years of their marriage, Michael had never given her anything-not even a flower petal, much less a bracelet.
Today, however, Yvonne was about to give her a bracelet that Michael had bought for her.
She knew Yvonne did it on purpose.
Wendy did not hear a single word of Michael's subsequent response.
""Wendy, your palms are bleeding!"" Zen called Wendy's name several times but he failed to get her to return to her senses.
Seeing that she was injured, Zen quickly unfurled her fists and saw blood dripping from her palms.
The wounds were a result of Wendy's nails digging deep into her flesh.
Wendy came to her senses and immediately retracted her hands. ""Let's get back to work now that we've finished our meal."" With that, Wendy stood up and left.
Feeling worried about Wendy, Zen quickly trailed after her. ""Wendy, please don't scare me. You're bleeding so much. Let me go back to the office with you and bandage your wounds,"" he said.
""I'm fine, just ignore me,"" said Wendy. She had long grown numb to the pain.
""How can you possibly be fine?"" asked Zen. ""I know that you're upset, you can cry or talk to me, but please don't suppress your emotions.""
""I'm really fine,"" Wendy repeated.
Looking at Wendy's soulless appearance, Zen felt worried and angry at the same time.
Sensing no intention on Wendy's part to stop walking, Zen shouted loudly, ""Wendy Stewart!""
The sudden loudness of his voice made Wendy stop in her tracks momentarily. Zen sneered at her from behind. ""Can you take a look at what you've turned into? ... In the past three years, you have grown submissive and relenting.""
""You used to be high-spirited, proud, and confident. You were the most attractive girl in our school. Half of the male student population wanted to woo you. You were also the most outstanding student in our school-you was praised by the teachers and were a role model for the other students. Back then, you said that you wanted to become the brightest star in the design industry. You wanted to stand on the international stage and shine radiantly ... You were clearly the bright moon, but for a man like this, you turned into a grain of dust.""
""You gave up on design, gave up on your dreams, and instead chose to stay beside Michael, making coffee for him every day!""
""Wendy Stewart, when will you wake up? Michael doesn't love you, why do you devalue yourself like this?""
Chapter 3: Something Felt Fishy
Zen's words replayed in Wendy's mind.
Indeed, Michael did not love her.
However, the first time she laid eyes on Michael, she had already lost herself. How could she possibly let go of three years of obsession?
When she returned to the office, Wendy witnessed Yvonne feeding Michael some sliced fruits. The smiles on their faces made her eyes sting.
They could have gone to the president's office to behave intimately, yet they deliberately chose to remain in the assistant's office.
More blood trickled down Wendy's palms, hidden beneath her sleeves.
When Yvonne saw Wendy coming in, she said with a smile, ""Miss Stewart, it's currently still lunchtime. Michael and intend to rest on the couch, why don't you go hang out in the lounge for a while?""
""This is my office,"" said Wendy and she remained where she was without moving.
Yvonne was obviously the guest in this office, yet she continued acting as though she owned the space.
Yvonne grabbed Michael's hand and started whining unhappily, ""Michael.""
Michael lifted his head. He regarded Wendy with raised eyebrows, his face displeased. ""I own this entire company, you have to go wherever I tell you to go. If you don't wish to work here anymore ...""
Before Michael could finish speaking, Wendy finally lost her temper. She said, ""Michael, is this the only thing you can threaten me with? Back then, you promised me that I could join the company and that you would not fire me if I did not leave voluntarily. In exchange, I would not appear before you and Yvonne whenever she came to the company. Now that she is working here as your assistant, I want you to agree to another condition.""
""Wendy Stewart, when did you become so obstinate?"" Michael could not help giving Wendy another glance as he observed the anger on her face.
He thought, 'this woman has never dared to disobey me. Now, she's negotiating with me?'
""I know you detest me and l cannot do anything about you wanting to bring Yvonne into the company. However, both of you are forbidden from public displays of affection before me. Otherwise, I will ...""
Before Wendy could finish speaking, Michael snorted. ""Otherwise? You're probably just going to complain to my grandmother.""
""You're absolutely right,"" said Wendy. At those words, she whipped out her mobile phone and stared directly at Michael. ""If you don't agree to my condition, I'll call your grandmother right now and tell her that you gave Yvonne a job in the company.""
Michael gazed at Wendy's hands and frowned lightly, feeling surprised about her injury.
However, he felt nothing but disgust and hatred toward Wendy. Naturally, he did not care that she was hurt.
""Michael ..."" Yvonne was afraid that Michael would agree just like that. She said coquettishly, ""I just want to hang out with you for a little longer.""
The atmosphere had grown really tense.
All three individuals in the office were silent. The entire space was alarmingly quiet.
This was the first time that Wendy was negotiating with Michael so bravely.
As his wife, her condition was for them to stop behaving intimately before her eyes. However, she was terrified. She was afraid that Michael would chase her out of the company in a moment of anger and insist on getting divorced.
Wendy felt that she was pitiful and pathetic at the same time.
After some time, Michael stood up and left the office.
Michael's lack of an outburst allowed Wendy to heave a sigh of relief.
""Wendy Stewart, don't presume that Michael's departure means that he has agreed to your condition,"" said Yvonne with a smile. ""You can threaten him with his grandmother for now, but I don't believe you can do that for the rest of your life. Just wait and see, I'll make sure Michael kicks you out of this company.""
Wendy paid no attention to Yvonne. She returned to her own desk and lowered her head, immersing herself in her work.
She knew she could not beat Yvonne.
Even though she was reluctant to admit it, Michael's heart did indeed belong to Yvonne.
***
In the following days, Yvonne and Michael still walked around the company around together. However, they never lingered at the assistant's office again.
Wendy knew that they continued their intimate behavior in places she could not see.
Sighing softly, she sorted out the documents on her desk and went to deliver them to Michael.
At that moment, Mr. York happened to be reporting to Michael about his work schedule for the rest of the day, ""In half an hour, you have a meeting with Mr. Collins about your collaboration. Your meeting location has been fixed at Hotel J. Miss Zendaya is the secretary assigned to this project. It takes about fifteen minutes to get there, so you should get ready to leave now.""
Yvonne had been sitting by the side using her mobile phone. When she spotted Wendy entering the room, her gaze changed. She rose and walked over to Michael, saying, ""Let me go with you. I want to make use of this opportunity to learn how I can help you with your work, Michael.""
""About that,"" said Mr. York, ""Miss Taylor, you have no experience in these matters. Why don't you wait until you're more familiar with the workflow?""
Mr. York was Michael's best assistant. He had been with Michael for five years and he had always been a hard and conscientious worker.
At the same time, he was also someone who could separate work and personal matters very well.
""Won't you and Michael be there as well? I just want to follow you along so I can gain some experience. I promise I won't be a hindrance,"" said Yvonne. The truth was that Yvonne was not a hardworking person, she merely wanted to agitate Wendy.
""Let her come along if she wants to. After all, the discussion is almost finished,"" Michael said before he turned to Yvonne and continued, ""Go look for Miss Zendaya and have her hand over the documents to you.""
""Thank you, Michael,"" said Yvonne. She set off to look for Miss Zendaya happily, but before she left, she raised her eyebrows at Wendy triumphantly.
Mr. York stared at Yvonne's retreating back, looking rather displeased.
He tried to persuade Michael, ""Mr. Lucas, you shouldn't allow Miss Taylor to have her way like that. It doesn't matter what you do in your private time, but it's better to set boundaries in work-related affairs.""
Michael raised his head unhappily. He retorted, ""Are you letting how much I pay you get to your head?""
Mr. York knew that there was nothing he could say that would be effective. Hence, he made no further comment.
After they left the office, Wendy packed up his work area.
She had just returned to her own office when the phone on her desk started ringing.
""Good afternoon, this is the assistant's office of MC Enterprise ...""
Before Wendy could finish speaking, Yvonne's voice was heard over the phone, ""Miss Stewart, we forgot to bring one of the documents. Can I please trouble you to bring it over for us? The folder is on my desk, you will see it when you walk over there.""
Wendy could not help but frown when she heard Yvonne's voice. She thought, 'this woman wants me to deliver a folder?'
Something about this felt fishy.
""Why are you asking her to do that, you can just get someone else,"" Michael's voice could be heard over the phone as well.
""She works in the same office as m and since the folder contains the business plan for this project, I don't feel at ease having someone else deliver it.""
Business plan?
Wendy thought, 'how can Yvonne claim to want to do a good job and then forget to bring such an important document?'
Wendy replied coldly, ""I'll send it over right away.""
After hanging up, Wendy walked over to Yvonne's table and saw the folder just as instructed.
She picked it up and made her way to Hotel J.
Yvonne was waiting for her outside the private room. Wendy handed the folder to Yvonne and immediately turned around to leave.
She had only managed to take two steps when Yvonne's furious voice could be heard from behind her, ""Miss Stewart, even if you have something against me, you should remain impartial at work. Today's discussion with Mr. Collins is such an important one, how could you ... how could you do this ...""
Wendy's footsteps came to a halt.
When Michael heard those words, he immediately emerged from the private room.
""Michael, look, this is the folder that Wendy delivered to me,"" said Yvonne as she handed it over to Michael. ""It's filled with blank paper.""
When Wendy heard those words, she shifted her gaze to the folder in Michael's hands.
Indeed, it was filled with blank paper.
""What is going on?"" Naturally, Wendy was the first person Michael interrogated.
""She told me that the folder was on her desk, and this is what I took from her desk,"" replied Wendy honestly.
She had already realized that Yvonne was trying to frame her.

Our community members appear trapped in a sea of bureaucracy & non-disclosure agreements, I'm asking for your help to try & get them a fair shake.

These properties are poor, & it appears we have known about it for over a decade; some have been demolished & some still have people residing in them who feel trapped. If the engineer's report is correct, there are safety risks for them, their families & us.

I'm now asking you, the residents of our community, to join me in saying enough is enough; something needs to be done before someone gets hurt, and not afterwards. 

These residents & their children need somewhere safe to live; their neighbours need to know that they are safe & someone has to look into why this has even happened in the first place.

Please sign the petition in the comments; this isn't asking for anything more than for the Minister to address any urgent safety issues &, if there aren't any, to provide us the engineer's reports & risk assessments that rebut the others stating that there is, and the properties need demolishing with undue delay.

It only takes a minute to show you support your neighbours, so please, get behind our community & show that we're stronger when we stand together.

I refuse to back down as our current government erodes our social contract.

Last year, I got that all-too-common email saying my rent was hiked $100 per week. And I'll be honest, as a single woman and community youth worker, I don't have a lot of buffer room to cover that.

In the electorate of Summer Hill, 45% of us are renters. We've all heard the stories: people forced from their home with a no- grounds eviction, unsafe conditions the dodgy landlord won't fix, or just struggling to cover unending rent hikes. For too many of us, home ownership has become a distant dream. I‚Äôm calling for sustainable, affordable housing and infrastructure that will meet community needs, and is accountable to us.

I am greatly aware of how female dominated professions such as my own, as well as teaching and nursing, have been chronically undervalued and underfunded despite our work being vital. I‚Äôm fighting to bolster our teachers and local schools to deal with rising education inequality. I‚Äôm supporting nurses, carers, and health staff through ratios across all wards and caring sites; and I‚Äôm demanding a reinvigoration of TAFE with free courses. I see how these mounting issues, due to a lack of government resourcing, affect our young people, our elderly, our essential workers, and I say enough.

I‚Äôm running for The Greens because the people of Summer Hill deserve a representative who is pushing boundaries on what we can achieve. I‚Äôm a youth worker, a writer, a young person, and a proud Cypriot woman living on unceded Wangal land.

,,3.24263E+15,9.73868E+14,the voice,Independent Family Solutions,"Domestic abuse after the relationship has ended

Domestic abuse can persevere after the relationship has ended. It becomes more concerning when new partners become involved in the family dynamics, trying to undermine the other parent's relationship's general or even basic principles. You, too, can be held accountable if you cohabitate in such dialogue or encourage this behaviour.
It's called psychological/emotional violence.
If this manner is directed at a child, dismissing, abusing, doubting, controlling, and causing anxiety, you are in breach of the law and could be punished.
As a forensic behaviour specialist consulting teenagers from abusive backgrounds, I am amazed at how these children's resilience and coping mechanisms withstand further abuse from new relationships and family. The issue is these children are not coping, and you are reinforcing a behaviour on a minor that, eventually, will break down.

In a training session, I presented factors affecting a child's development, such as nutrition, parents' behaviour, parenting, social and cultural practices, and environment. Children growing up in a toxic environment will dramatically affect their identity later in life. It is the upbringing that shapes the character.

A child needs positive experiences to develop social, emotional, language, cognitive and physical skills. That same child also has the right to be heard and is included in the 
""UN Convention of Rights"".  
""The Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1997"" is firmly based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and reflects the view that all efforts should be directed towards accurately balancing assessment of safety and risk with strengthening positive aspects in the individual, family, and community systems. 
A risk assessment is not a school report. 

Effects of toxicity I look for in a teenager/adult 
1. A loss of identity
2. Maintained distance between child and others
3. Engagement in toxic relationships as an adult
4. Blaming oneself
5. Failure is not an option
6. Constantly walking on eggshells
7. Compromised memory of childhood

Addressing the above requires intervention into the current state of play. Children have a voice and should be heard. 
Fortunately, spending many years in a children's home, coupled with discipline in the navy, taught me respect for authority and self-reliance. It is a chain of command that dictates decisions, who is in charge, and which tasks must be completed.
A massive contradiction in many family law cases.
We need a Royal Commission to confront the damage many Clinical, and Court psychologists engage in labelling a parent without due diligence.

Das basisdemokratische Forum des Berliner CSD e.V. hat √ºber das Motto des diesj√§hrigen Berlin Pride | Berliner CSD am 22. Juli 2023 entschieden. Mit einer erwartenden Teilnehmendenanzahl von ca. 500.000 Menschen, zieht der Berliner CSD 2023 unter folgendem Motto durch die noch nicht finale Route der Berliner Innenstadt: 
 
‚Äî‚Äî 

Be their voice - and ours!
...f√ºr mehr Empathie und Solidarit√§t! 

‚Äî‚Äî 

Die Grundstruktur des diesj√§hrigen Mottos, lehnt sich an jene des Jahres 2022 an, soll durch seine bilinguale Version auch nicht deutschsprachgige Menschen repr√§sentieren und wird auch in 2023 durch einen Slogan erg√§nzt, welcher den Fokus setzt. Die Text-/ schriftliche Version des Mottos ist leicht abweichend und bewusst gew√§hlt. 

Das Forum und der Vorstand des Berliner CSD e.V. m√∂chten hierbei anmerken, dass es wichtig ist, dass wir nicht nur auf externe sondern auch interne Konfliktpotentiale aufmerksam machen m√ºssen. Sexualit√§ten, Identit√§ten und Lebensformen, die unserer LGBTIQA* Minderheit angeh√∂ren oder auch nicht angeh√∂ren, sollten in einer pluralen Gesellschaft ohne Ausnahmen mitbedacht und ihrer Selbstbestimmung akzeptiert als auch unterst√ºtzt werden. Ob queere Menschen, die Opfer des Krieges gegen die ukrainische Bev√∂lkerung sind, queere Menschen w√§hrend der Iran-Revolution oder im kleinsten Kreis in unserer Stadt Berlin, in der es zwischen √ºberrepr√§sentierten und kaum wahrnehmbaren (sichtbaren) Menschen unserer Community, oftmals fehlende Empathie und Solidarit√§t gibt. Wir m√ºssen endlich wieder jene Regenbogenstadt werden, von der alle so gern sprechen - als Gemeinschaft - und durch mehr Support der Politik. Ihren Worten muss grundlegend mehr Aktionismus folgen. 

Minderheiten d√ºrfen nicht gegeneinander ausgespielt werden. Es bedarf mehr Solidarit√§t und Empathie, um eine plurale Gesellschaft zu bauen, zu festigen und diese demokratische S√§ule zu verteidigen.  

Wir bitten euch die Grafik (Bild) in ihrer Form zu benutzen und nicht zu ver√§ndern, da die Motto-Grafik durch eine Pr√ºfung zur Lesbarkeit f√ºr Menschen mit Seheinschr√§nkungen und/ oder -behinderungen durchlief.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=207107231982778

I'm standing to be the Greens candidate for Kellyville in the 2023 NSW election as l believe that we cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around us. 

As a mother of two, l‚Äôm greatly aware of how teaching has been undervalued despite the vital effect it has on society. I'm supporting teachers, early childhood educators, and l‚Äôm also demanding free TAFE courses for all, something which will ensure we are able to provide strong work opportunities for those who are disadvantaged in the workforce. I'm also aware of the importance of education and will give the people of Kellyville a strong voice on that.

It is very apparent how important it is to have access to green spaces, youth spaces, local swimming pools, to have well-maintained footpaths, bike lanes and more schools in the area. I will be pushing to invest more in all of these areas.

We are facing a cost-of-living crisis which is pushing our fellow community members out of area. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be pushing for the government to reduce the cost of public transport, healthcare and housing.

As a member of this community, my future concerns for children and youth is always around the corner in my mind and l believe we all need to take action on the climate emergency for a better future that we all deserve! We must phase out coal and gas, and retain existing bushland if we‚Äôre going to keep our environment intact.

I'm running for the Greens because people of Kellyville deserve a representative who understands the need of the neighbourhood. Last but not least ""never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."" The Earth is what we all have in common and the environment is where we all meet and where all have a mutual interest. It is the only thing all of us share!

I hope to have your support at the NSW election in March!

From the Heart #YES23 campaign launched in Adelaide and Australian Unions launched the Unions for YES campaign online (you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow) as the vast majority still support recognition and consultation being enshrined in the constitution.

At his 35th #MardiGras parade Albo became the 1st sitting PM to march at Mardi Gras as towards the back Tsarina Thorpe, self proclaimed ""Movement Leader"", staged a one woman protest and had to be removed.

Sadly Insiders became a turgid mess when Speers became fixated on ""Florence"" the bogged drill as Chris Bowen MP attempted to discuss emissions reduction policy, then for the second week in a row Speers obsessed over a minor detail in the Voice referendum working group that guest Mark Kenny called a ""phantom argument"" and finally Speers managed to round out the show by spending less than 10 seconds on the largest cut to real wages, record corporate profits and the greed-price spiral by throwing to the Murdoch journalist who made a quip about airline prices.

As you can imagine, Ben gets fired up today.

Ben also covers off the remaining dates to see The Week on Wednesday LIVE at Adelaide Fringe tix here:  https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023

,,9.82785E+14,1.93164E+14,the voice,The School of Visibility,"Your work is too important to be silenced by visibility blocks. (Fears around being seen and heard.)

Visibility blocks look like worrying about being criticised for not knowing enough, having the 'wrong' body shape, being judged for being too successful, too different, and/or too much.

They stop you from: 
‚Üí building your business, 
‚Üí writing your book, 
‚Üí pursuing your dream speaking gig, or 
‚Üí advocating for your favourite cause.

Visibility blocks don't arise by chance. Systemic inequality plays a significant role in their creation. And systemic inequality is maintained by a dominant mindset that centres one perspective and one set of values. 

When your experience isn't centred by the system, it's easy to start questioning yourself. To doubt your own worth. 

'Smash the Patriarchal Mindset' is a 4 day course that looks specifically at the patriarchal mindset. It steps you through the impact it's having on your experience of visibility; using your voice and taking up space in the world.

Adding your voice really will make a huge difference to any business you shout out, and best of all, you don't need to register or sign in or anything, and depending on how much you have to say, helping us could take you as little as a minute or two!

Feedback can be given if you live, work or shop in Yarra (e.g. at Eagle or The Laird or any of the other queer businesses here!) even if you are a visitor from interstate or overseas.

We would love to see you add your feedback to Yarra's ""Your Say"" about which venues around Yarra are important to you, to ensure that Yarra continues to be ‚Äúthe place to be‚Äù for LGBTQIA+ residents and travelers in the Southern Hemisphere.  

Share your personal insights and memories about our store and other LGBTQIA+ businesses in our area, so that Council can better understand, protect and celebrate our heritage. Your feedback will help Yarra Council in updating the Thematic History of Yarra and may inform statements of significance used in their heritage listing.

Alison and Monteanna are Timber Creek Rangers working in the Victoria River District in the Northern Territory. They support the Voice.

---

The Northern Land Council and its members have been involved in the fight for representative engagement with governments for many years ‚Äì including the Yirrkala Bark Petition in 1963 and the Barunga Statement in 1988. 

In 2015, the NLC, as a member of Aboriginal Peak Organisations of the Northern Territory (APONT) confirmed its support for constitutional recognition.

In 2017 the NLC hosted a regional dialogue in Darwin where more than 100 Aboriginal people from across the NT came together to discuss Constitutional reform and recognition. An elected Indigenous voice to Parliament was the number one preference.

In 2018 the NLC and the Central Land Council provided a submission to the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples that supported the establishment of a constitutionally-entrenched national body to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

At Kalkarindji in August 2022 the four NT Land Councils made a joint resolution in support of a referendum for a Voice in the current term of government.

The NLC is a member of the Referendum Engagement Group.

Thanks to everyone who came along to the Darwin Railway Club last night to hear more about how to back the Voice and achieve a resounding YES in the October/November referendum. 

The Voice is constitutional recognition of our First Nations people to ensure they have a say in matters that affect their lives. Pretty simple, pretty fair. 

It‚Äôs not a veto on legislation or a third chamber of parliament. It‚Äôs an advisory body to help us get things right and close the gap. 

We‚Äôll be holding more events throughout the year ‚Äî and you can come down to Parap Village Shops & Saturday Market this Saturday to talk to our Voice supporters if you‚Äôve got any questions you want answered, or if you‚Äôd like to help out.

The Murdoch organisation has boycotted the Adelaide Fringe, Australia's largest arts festival, after a dispute about advertising.  Van and Ben look at what Australia's NINTH largest newspaper boycotting Australia's largest arts event has to do with Trump, Fox News, Sky News and the cultural war that has turned news audiences into market segments.

In the Yurt Van and Ben expose that ""broccolini"" is a trademarked term and that some of the agri-corp businesses, many around Adelaide, may not be all they seem.  The United Workers Union are encouraging people to contact Coles and Woolworths to demand that exploitation doesn't make it on Australian tables.  Don't forget you can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

With The Statement from the Heart YES campaign launching and the Unions for YES campaign underway Van and Ben open the show with a traditional acknowledgement of country and discuss how Murdoch's NO campaign is as much about about subscription and advertising sales as it is trying to stop the referendum.

Albo spoke at the National Press Club about the concepts that underpin national security and Ben and Van explore how a broader understanding of security, security of employment, of pay, of opportunity and community participation comes together as the counter to the Murdoch organisation's project and Dutton's ""Noalition"".

Plus there is good news about renewable energy batteries.

Just recently, the MP visited Waubra to have lunch at Waubra's lovely Wayward Winery, before posting on Facebook, to say how great the view in Waubra is!

To add insult to injury Juliana Addison MP chimed in to say that she too would love to drop in for lunch.

THIS HYPOCRISY IS CRAZY??!

The same view Labor's Martha Haylett MP has taken a photo of (below) will soon feature Labor's 190km of 85 meter tall transmission lines!

If that doesn't spoil the landscape in Waubra enough, Labor will also plonk a terminal station 12X the size of the MCG right in the middle.

Perhaps it's understandable why Martha and Juliana want to get in and enjoy the view now? Becasue in a few years time, Labor will have turned the beautiful farming town of Waubra into a devastating industrial wasteland, and call it a success for 'green' energy.

When the rest of the world is putting transmission lines underground, or investing in residential and business solar where it needs it most, OUR CITIES, the best Labor can do is dump their antiquated electricity infrastructure in small rural towns that don't have a voice.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=607749941391862

---

The Northern Land Council and its members have been involved in the fight for representative engagement with governments for many years ‚Äì including the Yirrkala Bark Petition in 1963 and the Barunga Statement in 1988. 

In 2015, the NLC, as a member of Aboriginal Peak Organisations of the Northern Territory (APONT) confirmed its support for constitutional recognition.

In 2017 the NLC hosted a regional dialogue in Darwin where more than 100 Aboriginal people from across the NT came together to discuss Constitutional reform and recognition. An elected Indigenous voice to Parliament was the number one preference.

In 2018 the NLC and the Central Land Council provided a submission to the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples that supported the establishment of a constitutionally entrenched national body to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

At Kalkarindji in August 2022 the four NT Land Councils made a joint resolution in support of a referendum for a Voice in the current term of government.

The NLC is a member of the Referendum Engagement Group.

A new report by the CSIRO has revealed the size of Australia‚Äôs invasive species problem. Globally, invasive species are ranked as having the 5th biggest impact on nature, but in Australia they are NUMBER ONE üíî

Nationally, invasive species have contributed to a whopping 75% of extinctions, and they STILL imperil at LEAST another 123 threatened species üêæ

Dealing with invasive species must be a national priority if we want to maintain our way of life and the identity of Australia. We want our bush to look like the Australian bush, not one invaded by a plethora of weeds and diseases.

Red fire ants are changing the way we live, work and play. Invasive ants have the potential to change the whole way Australia functions ‚Äî they are BBQ stoppers. 

Hungry predators like feral cats kill 2 BILLION native animals alone each year.

With a crossbench already double the size of the federal Parliament crossbench before the last election, it looks like NSW is heading towards independents having the balance of power. 

I take that responsibility very seriously.  It‚Äôs important we return to the sensible centre and I‚Äôve already laid out what I would look for from both major parties in the event neither form majority government. To protect Pittwater and the state I will seek: 

üí™ more ambitious pokies reforms from both parties 
üí™ long awaited improvements to Pittwater‚Äôs schools, hospitals, and roads 
üí™ an end to inappropriate development, like the controversial Lizard Rock development
üí™ support for my bill to stop PEP-11

Ben looks at the first two weeks of the parliamentary sitting for 2023 where Labor introduced housing policy, manufacturing policy and emissions reduction policy all of which were opposed by Dutton and the Greens.  Plus our friend Mary Doyle is running for Aston following Tudge's retirement.

The bosses pamphlets have argued against working people being involved in the running of the country but you can have your say by joining your union at australianunions.org.au/wow

Adam Bandt went on Insiders and couldn't name one country that has banned new coal and gas, couldn't say how much it would cost and wouldn't support his own Senator's statement that the government should arbitrarily override the RBA.  Ben discusses why the RBA is wrong and how the government can systemically address the issues without random interventions.

While the nation is gearing up for the launch of YES to The Voice campaigns (union online launch this Wednesday night https://www.australianunions.org.au/action/voice-campaign-launch  and Statement from the Heart campaign launch on Thursday https://fromtheheart.com.au/take-action) Samantha Maiden repeated Dutton talking points about the Voice not ""fixing things"" on Insiders.  

Ben looks at how empowerment has improved outcomes in the NDIS and why The Voice will help close the gap.

And finally Ben takes a look at the chaos that is the NSW Liberal state government.  From Minister's distributing explicit pictures to undisclosed conflicts of interest in toll roads to MPs banned from entering parliament while facing criminal charges running as an ""independant"" the Liberal-National Coalition looks on the ropes.  

UnionsNSW is running a campaign ""Essential Workers Deserve Better"" focused on the high costs, low wages, high workload approach of the Liberals that Labor has promised to change.

Van and Ben will be doing the Week on Wednesday LIVE! from Adelaide Fringe https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023 for the next four weeks.

Luckily, we don‚Äôt need the details to know that the Voice is a bad idea. Any reasonable, sensible person understands that dividing our great multicultural nation by race is not only a bad idea, it is the very description of racism.

The words of a great man, many years ago, still ring true today. ‚ÄòI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.‚Äô

From what I have gathered, we need more communal spaces! We need more areas in our public space which welcomes interaction and promotes a sense of community.
It is important to mention however that disability inclusion and diversity in the way we design our spaces is of priority. No matter what your ability may be, a community is not complete without your existence.

What are your thoughts?

I migrated to Australia from Iran at the age of 5 and today I am an architectural designer passionate about spaces intended for the support of neuro divergent individuals. As a graduate of Masters in Architecture, I have developed principles and policies aimed towards the support of individuals living with mental health disabilities.

My activism for human rights has taken me as far as India to assist villages with housing needs and today I am passionate about the Iranian revolution as it is making way for a change which is long overdue.

As an immigrant, a designer, and an activist for human rights, I can recognise the demand for inclusion and diversity towards a growing and sustainable future.

I believe our community is formed by a rich array of races, beliefs, and experiences, all of which are required to be heard and understood. I believe that communication with the people who have shaped our setting is of utmost importance and will make the biggest difference in growth for a better tomorrow.

We are in the midst of a rising housing crisis and our environment is in a concerning ecological state as a result of investor greed, over development and our economy‚Äôs over-reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, the gender pay gap and lack of access to health and disability support is merely maintained and rarely spoken about.

Our community deserves equal and universal access to high quality public services with enough diversity to take into account everyone‚Äôs needs. If elected, I intend to broadcast this voice alongside those unheard as I would love to see our environment designed by those living in it. I am hopeful for our future because I recognise the kindness and capabilities that we have in our society.

The event features high-level experts in the field of Indigenous rights and cultural understanding, Canadian First Nations Leaders Lewis Cardinal, Chief Lee Crowfield and Rainbow Cardinal, as well as the Cathedral‚Äôs First Nations Canon, Uncle Glenn Loughrey.

Lewis Cardinal is a communicator and educator from the Sucker Creek Cree First Nation in northern Alberta, Canada. He has received numerous awards for his work in promoting cross-cultural connections and human rights. As Vice-Chair for the North American Interfaith Network Council and Trustee of the Council for a Parliament of World Religions, he has been conferred with an Honorary Doctor of Sacred Letters from St. Stephen‚Äôs College at the University of Alberta. He is the Project Manager for ‚Äúkihciy askiy‚ÄìSacred Land‚Äù in the City of Edmonton, Canada‚Äôs first urban Indigenous ceremony grounds, and the founder of Cardinal Strategic Communications, which specialises in Indigenous education, communications, and project development.

Chief Lee Crowfield is a Traditional Knowledge Keeper of Tsuut‚Äôina Nation, a third generation of Crowchild Xakijis. He has been an Xakiji (Chief) of the Tsuut‚Äôina First Nation. A sought-after speaker and writer on environmental and sustainable energy practices, Chief Lee Crowfield is passionate about protecting the environment and finding ways to ensure the rights of Treaty are preserved.

Rainbow Cardinal currently lives in Treaty 6 Territory, in Canada‚Äôs central west (present-day Alberta and Saskatchewan). The daughter of a Residential School Survivor, she has recently collaborated on a short version of her personal story of experiencing the effects of intergenerational trauma. She is working on a book to tell the story of her personal healing journey, as well as her first poetry collection, and is excited to also be working on a documentary project with her brother, Lewis.

Together with St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral First Nations Canon and Chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Anglican Council, Uncle Glenn Loughrey, the panel discussion will provide members of the Cathedral community and the wider public with the opportunity to inform themselves about the Voice to Parliament, and to learn from the perspectives of leading First Nations experts. 

If passed, the proposal of a Voice to Parliament would establish a representative body for Indigenous Australians to give them a greater say in policy and decision-making that affects their communities. The Voice to Parliament is a crucial step towards reconciliation and self-determination for Indigenous people in Australia.

The community needs an answer from the NSW Nationals as to why our needs were not triaged higher than other locations, which based on the publicly available data, appear less urgent.

- - - - - - - 
Independents bring a different kind of politics, they are consultive, collaborative and work constructively across party lines to get things done. Independent MPs are only answerable to their community.  Independents can:
‚Ä¢ Genuinely represent the people of Myall Lakes 
‚Ä¢ Hold members of the government to account
‚Ä¢ Vote independently and speak freely on the issues
‚Ä¢ Introduce new legislation into parliament

I will be a strong independent voice for equity in rural healthcare and will work with anyone who is truely committed to ensuring the healthcare needs of rural communities.  Allocation of resources needs to be free of politics no matter who is in government.  

This would have delivered Stage 2 for Manning Base Hospital (promised in 2018) and would have seen Forster-Tuncurry Hospital built as well.

,,1.40373E+15,1.06756E+14,the voice,Save Our Spuds,"Late last year Labor's Martha Haylett MP announced that Labor wants to move the AusNet terminal station (12X the size of the MCG), from Mt Prospect to Waubra - a tiny farming community just outside of Ballarat.

Just recently, the MP visited Waubra to have lunch at Waubra's lovely Wayward Winery, before posting on Facebook, to say how great the view in Waubra is!

To add insult to injury Juliana Addison MP chimed in to say that she too would love to drop in for lunch.

THIS HYPOCRISY IS CRAZY??!

The same view Labor's Martha Haylett MP has taken a photo of (below) will soon feature Labor's 190km of 85 meter tall transmission lines!

If that doesn't spoil the landscape in Waubra enough, Labor will also plonk a terminal station 12X the size of the MCG right in the middle.

However, perhaps we can understand why Martha Haylett MP and Juliana Addison MP might want to get in and enjoy the view now, becasue in a years time Labor will have turned the beautiful farming town of Waubra into a devastating industrial wasteland. 

When the rest of the world is putting transmission lines underground, or investing in residential and business solar where it needs it most, OUR CITIES, the best Labor can do is dump their antiquated electricity infrastructure in small rural towns that don't have a voice.",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=1403730357098299

In the electorate of Summer Hill, 45% of us are renters. We've all heard the stories: people forced from their home with a no- grounds eviction, unsafe conditions the dodgy landlord won't fix, or just struggling to cover unending rent hikes. For too many of us, home ownership has become a distant dream. I‚Äôm calling for sustainable, affordable housing and infrastructure that will meet community needs, and is accountable to us.

I am greatly aware of how female dominated professions such as my own, as well as teaching and nursing, have been chronically undervalued and underfunded despite our work being vital. I‚Äôm fighting to bolster our teachers and local schools to deal with rising education inequality. I‚Äôm supporting nurses, carers, and health staff through ratios across all wards and caring sites; and I‚Äôm demanding a reinvigoration of TAFE with free courses. I see how these mounting issues, due to a lack of government resourcing, affect our young people, our elderly, our essential workers, and I say enough.

I‚Äôm running for The Greens because the people of Summer Hill deserve a representative who is pushing boundaries on what we can achieve. I‚Äôm a youth worker, a writer, a young person, and a proud Cypriot woman living on unceded Wangal land.

I am not your average politician. I am your community advocate.

,,5.87537E+14,1.10018E+14,the voice,Australian Borders for a better future. Australia First,"THE LUCKY COUNTRY
David Horne's said ""Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people‚Äôs ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.‚Äù

This is so true of our leaders of the past 16 years. Even though this was written in 1964.

I'm proud to be Australian and I will always be an Australian as are my fellow indigenous people are Australian and all the other people who now call Australia home are Australian.

Why do they keep demonstrating and calling us colonizers, that we need to give up the country we have supposed to have stolen, why do they call us oppressor's, murderers, colonizers, slave traders, that we are white supremacies', we are trashing their dignity, their culture, that we have to continually apologize for something none of us have done or are guilty of in the past, this is now this is the present look to the future. The agitators, the lefties, the socialists blame us for the Incarceration rates, deaths in custody and child removals which they tell us are all the symptoms of an ongoing war against the indigenous people in this Country. They want a Treaty to end the war.  What War? what oppression?
Do these people know how lucky they are to be able to freely demonstrate, to voice an opinion and how these rights where obtained? No they don't.
We live in a country that provides security for all, freedom of expression and voice. We have bountiful opportunities for all Australians to be grasped. Why do they not grasp and treasure these benefits, these privileges' that other people of the world would want and rightly deserve.
We aren't in Syria, devastated by war, earthquake and famine.
We aren't in earthquake devastated Turkey, 
We aren't fighting for our lives and homes in Ukraine, 
We need not fear the police when they pull us over like in the USA. 
We can send our children to school knowing they will come home and not be murdered whilst at school like the USA.
We aren't in South Africa where you can't work or are forced to live in ghettos. 
We aren't subjugated like the people of Russia or Belorussia. 
We aren't having our homes raided in Burkina Fuso, or burnt out in the AMAZON,
We don't have power and food issues in England. 
We aren't Terrorized in Afghanistan, or persecuted in Palestine,
Our rights aren't trampled as they are in IRAN, 
Your religion isn't hailed as evil as it is in Pakistan if you are christian. 
We aren't held captive in North Korea, or abused in China. 
We aren't starving like the peoples of AFRICA and South America.

We call Australia home for the reason we are free, we live securely, we aren't racist, we have fair system of justice for all, opportunity in Education, Health and Employment. We have food, water and family. We obtain these things for all Australians, no matter colour, creed, religion or beliefs. This comes from our civilized belief in our system, the system that has made this country Australia.
We can freely vote, enjoy life, be free to explore, choose who you work for, human rights for one and all.

This is why I love Australia and regard all people in Australia as Australians. We do not need to be divided by colour, creed, religion, race or belief.  There is no war there is no famine there is no mass persecution of Australians. We are the lucky country the lucky people. We should cherish and rejoice in that, not shout it down, and destroy what we have and how we all achieve it.

Van Badham and Ben Davison examine former Greens Senator for Victoria Lidia Thorpe's announcement that she is no longer a Green Party member but is now leader of ""a grassroots Blak sovereign movement.""

They look at the commentary around her split from the Greens, events leading up to this moment, what ""a grassroots Blak sovereign movement"" might actually mean based on Thorpe's public statements and the implications for democracy and the Voice referendum.

Thorpe's announcement, made standing alone in a hallway, came on the first sitting day of parliament for 2023 where a large number of issues are being debated, including more improvements for workers rights.  You can join your union at australianunions.org.au/wow to make sure you get your proper wages and conditions.

Dark Brandon (a play on a meme about Joe Biden) rose today as Joe Biden nailed the Republican's during the State of the Union Address.  Van and Ben discuss how Qanon talking points, culture wars and performative politics have so consumed the Republicans that Biden was able to get them to publicly show support for social security and Medicare while their leaders accuse one another of horrendous crimes, ban books and want to legislate putting sugar in milk.

Plus there is good news from the SEA about both hydrogen and plastics!

Van also gives an on air promise to sign copies of her book Qanon and On for anyone who comes to see the Week on Wednesday LIVE! at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/the-week-on-wednesday-live-with-van-badham-ben-davison-live-podcast-af2023

,,1.16499E+15,4.92074E+14,the voice,Judy Hannan MP - Member for Wollondilly,"Wollondilly Treated with Utter Disdain by the Government
 
As many of you will now be aware yesterday‚Äôs announcement by the NSW State Government of the distribution of funding from WestInvest has been a DEVESTATING blow to the community of Wollondilly. $1.6 Billion Dollars was awarded across 15 Local Government Areas in Western Sydney.
 
Distributed evenly this would represent $106.7 Million Dollars to each LGA.
Wollondilly was refused Community Halls, Men‚Äôs Shed, Cycleways as well as  Art and Sporting facilities, while surrounding areas received Aquatic Centre and Stadiums
 
Wollondilly LGA received $10.9 Million Dollars - LESS THAN 1% of the Fund
And only 10% of the Average Distribution per Local Government area.
 
 
The surrounding LGA‚Äôs Of Camden, Campbelltown and Penrith have received approximately $98m, $145m and $222m respectively
 
Applications were made for many vital improvements to Wollondilly including:
 
‚Ä¢ Stone Quarry Creek Boardwalk (a Key Election Promise by Nathaniel Smith and the then Treasurer Dominic Perrottet in the 2019 State Election)!!!
‚Ä¢ Wollondilly Cultural Precinct
‚Ä¢ Hume Oval Upgrade
‚Ä¢ Community Hall Mount Hunter
‚Ä¢ Dudley Chesham Phase 1 B
‚Ä¢ New Men‚Äôs Shed Building Warradale
‚Ä¢ Tahmoor Sports Ground Upgrades
‚Ä¢ Douglas Park Sportsground Masterplan
‚Ä¢ Telopea Park Buxton
‚Ä¢ Thirlmere East Park
‚Ä¢ East Bargo Park
‚Ä¢ New Multisport Facility Wilton
‚Ä¢ Picton Town Centre Parking Strategy
‚Ä¢ Picton RV Station
 
‚Ä¢ Tahmoor to Bargo Cycleway
‚Ä¢ Radnor Road Bargo
 
 
Wollondilly has been comprehensively ignored and treated with utter disdain by the current Government.
 
THIS IS A RECURRING THEME under their LEADERSHIP.
 
Regional Road Repair Funding of $500m has been announced for regional councils. WINGECARRIBBEE has received less than HALF of ONE PERCENT of this money or $1,800 for each Kilometre of the roads allocated for this funding.
 
The State Seat of Wollondilly is crying out for additional Public High Schools with only 2 Public High Schools (Picton High and Bowral High) yet with $478.2m dollars being announce for Schools across the 15 LGAs there is NOTHING for Wollondilly and the Southern Highlands
 
The State Government have made no effort to take back responsibility for State Roads that, as far as they are concerned terminate at the Wollondilly boundary and then recommence on the other side of Wollondilly LGA thus leaving Wollondilly in an impossible position in adequately caring for all the roads in Wollondilly
 
The very professional Fire and Rescue NSW Service has been asking for ONE additional Appliance to allow them to Respond to Emergencies in Wollondilly and The Southern Highlands but they have been told NO.
 
This is how The State Seat of Wollondilly has been treated whilst having and Elected Member in the Government.
 
What is VITAL in heading into the Election is to consider the Impact of YOUR VOTE ‚Äì will you choose to vote as you did in 2019 or will you make the decision to give The State Seat of Wollondilly a CARING, COMMITED, POWERFUL VOICE IN MACQUARIE STREET.
 
Other Independents are Standing to Unseat Liberals in their areas.

Under the previous federal Liberal Government, we banned importation of elephant ivory, rhino horn, lion parts and trophies being brought into the country.

Ben looks at the Chifley Research Centre conference in Canberra where Albo has defined the referendum as being about two principles; Recognition and Consultation, Tony Burke has outlined the next phases of workplace law reforms and Jim Chalmers has built on his excellent Monthly essay where he essentially argues that society and the economy are two sides of the same coin.  Ben explores what that might mean in the context of the inflation challenge, falling living standards and record profits in some sectors.

Saturday was World Cancer day and Ben reminds us why union safety standards are so important; 1 in 10 cancers around the world are due to workplace exposure to hazardous material.

,,5.5735E+14,2.03683E+15,the voice,Mark Rodda Independent Candidate for Tamworth,"Dear Fellow Electors
We are witness to the serious land use conflicts between farming communities of the Liverpool Plains and Gunnedah district. There is no doubt PEL‚Äôs 1 and 12 should be extinguished. There should be no coal seam gas mining on the Plains or the North-West - Full Stop.

In Nundle and Hanging Rock we also have a resource development proposal that Tamworth Regional Council has objected to and local majority objection has been demonstrated during two gruelling EIS public exhibitions.

Community division has eroded social capital established over decades of collaborative volunteering, and continues to impact community members‚Äô mental health and wellbeing.

Yet, the developer continues to force this proposal on the community because of the level of profit at stake. Not a good look for the Engie brand. Even metropolitan voters concerned about keeping the lights and air conditioning on want a ‚ÄúJust‚Äù and genuinely environmentally friendly transition to renewables.

Hills of Gold Wind Farm is outside of three neighbouring Renewable Energy Zones (Orana Central West, New England and Hunter), it threatens species protected by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and two neighbouring national parks.

The Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall MP is to be commended for speaking out on renewables resource developments proposed too close to people and in environmentally sensitive locations at Kentucky and Walcha.

The Member for Tamworth Kevin Anderson MP has stated for five years that the Hills of Gold Wind Farm is up to the community to decide. Yet in the face of repeated evidence of no social licence he won‚Äôt add his voice to lobby his own party on behalf of the people most impacted. The majority of immediate neighbours and the community of interest who do not support the proposal.

The new State Government has an opportunity to avoid the kind of community land use conflicts by truly listening to communities and taking notice of their own consultation. Be transparent with communities and put legislation in place to stop resource developments in inappropriate locations.

I chatted with Michael from ABC North Queensland Radio, ironically while on the side of the road, to discuss the issue of mobile blackspots throughout our region.

While under the Coalition government mobile and data connectivity was slowly improving, but Federal Labor has slashed $37.5 million from the Mobile Blackspots Program.  

This program will now hold the lowest level of investment since 2015.

Our region punches above its weight, but we need the services and infrastructure to continue to provide for our nation.  Phone coverage is a necessity in 2023 and shouldn‚Äôt be a luxury only for those living in capital cities.

Please complete the survey and HAVE YOUR SAY ... this issue is one of my many priorities heading down to Canberra.

Ben Davison takes a closer look at the situation in Alice Springs and how the end of a 15 year ban on alcohol in some communities coincided with cuts to support services, a federal election and a Morrison government unable to think beyond the news cycle combined to create the slow moving storm that has now engulfed the community.  
And maybe provides the clearest example of why The Voice is needed.

Ben looks at how the West Australian opposition, with only six lower house members across two parties, has managed to find itself in disarray at the start of 2023.

With more companies abandoning ships Ben takes a look at the case of the Yangtze Fortune and the crew.  Owed money, unable to get home to the Philippines and no clear path to freedom the workers are relying on the ITF Asia Pacific - International Transport Workers' Federation and the Maritime Union to make it through each day.

After enduring a horrific apartment experience last year and moving to a different state, I thought we had put it to bed and moved on with our lives. But, The Universe has other plans for I, it works through us. (It was NOT over btw.)

See I thought I was going to be a singer when I grew up, my voice is my soul. It‚Äôs the passion that lights the fire under my insides. Yet I had constant external forces saying, ‚Äúwhen are you going to learn to shut your mouth.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis world doesn‚Äôt like a mouthy young lady.‚Äù Well, when you allow your four year old daughter to watch Rush Limbaugh at her leisure, she is going to find her own values in the world pretty quickly. And I did.

Knowing what I know now, everything I experienced over the years was in an effort to wake me up. Learning how to heal my own body because the US government‚Äôs foundation of learning for doctors in this country leaves out a key method to healing, for example. This was just one point of awareness over the course of a lifetime. Or maybe how an old friend of mine used to work at Wells Fargo and I was a victim of their account scheme back in the day when she worked there. This wasn‚Äôt aware to me until I saw Dirty Money, we are no longer friends. The list is endless. 

So here I find myself in Kansas City, MO. A notoriously deep Red state with some deep problems that have lead me to become a full-blown activist. Grant and I have had to become actual crime fighters, just two weeks ago chasing down a thief that made off with some woman‚Äôs bag in broad daylight. After having been mugged and assaulted in New York, this was a win that we got her bag back! Scooter Gang to the Rescue!! 

On a serious note, my first step in the state healthcare issue is getting the federal government involved because Missouri is breaking federal laws. The wealthy population thrives here while the financial divide grows so wide, it can only be compared to that of a science fiction film. I thought I was going to be a singer, a fashionista, a model, an actress. But deep down I always knew I was just looking for the means to find a platform to make a difference in the world. So here I go.",['instagram.com'],['instagram.com'],,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=892911928414209

For this day to be significant, we must look beyond the surface-level pride in our nation and acknowledge the deep-rooted trauma endured by many Indigenous Australians due to colonisation and dispossession. 

While we acknowledge our day of national pride, consider the country's heritage dates back millions of years, and our first people's voice quietened two hundred ago. A change of date may not give back the years. Nonetheless, it may allow Indigenous voices to join the national pride. 

Compassion can bridge divides, unite us in understanding and create pathways for healing. This Australia Day, let‚Äôs recognise the pain of our country‚Äôs past and commit ourselves to create a future where everyone can share in the joy of celebrating together with pride.  Let‚Äôs make sure that this day is remembered not only for its celebration but also for the compassion we show towards each other as Australians.

Ben Davison looks at the recent polling showing a surge in support for Chris Minns and the NSW Labor party at the expense of Dom Perrottet's Liberal/National coalition government.  Ben goes through why working people have had enough of the cuts, the costs and the waste during  a decade of mismanagement by the Liberals.  Also how unions are getting organised to win better pay, services and more secure jobs, join them at australianunions.org.au/wow 

You can check out Van and Ben's interview with Labor leader Chris Minns from December 7th on Episode 114 of The Week on Wednesday.

The Voice enjoys support from a majority of Australian's in a majority of states.  While Dutton ""reaches for the Abbott playbook"" and the conservative media try to pretend otherwise every state, except Queensland, would deliver a comfortable majority YES to for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice referendum.  Ben breaks it down state by state.

Ben touches on the retirement of Jacinda Ardern. Van's Guardian article articulates why she was important, not just to New Zealand but to many people around the world.

Ben closes off with an examination of the escalating problems at Qantas.  Remember you can hear what the maintenance workers were telling Ben and Van back in September in Episode 104 about Joyce's cuts.  SIX MONTHS BEFORE the four ""mechanical issues"" in three days that the airline has suffered this week.

,,7.01383E+14,2.75746E+14,the voice,Palliative Care Australia,"In episode 2 of our new video & podcast series Thursdays@3, Prof Samar Aoun, Western Australia‚Äôs Australian of the Year 2023, shares with us that spark that started her passion for palliative care and reflects on her own Australian story as a migrant from Lebanon.    

Samar advocates for a person-centred approach to the end of life.  

She focuses on under-served groups such as those with motor neurone disease (MND) and dementia, people who are terminally ill and live alone, and those caring for a loved one. 

She wears many hats - she is the Perron Institute Research Chair in Palliative Care at The University of Western Australia and an Adjunct Professor at La Trobe University. She also co-founded the South West Compassionate Communities Network and leads the Compassionate Connectors Program.  

As Samar says, ‚Äúyou only die once so make it a good one‚Äù. You can also listen to the podcast version on Spotify ‚û°Ô∏è https://open.spotify.com/episode/5swrAfkrpuKtBYuJRz3T0Q?si=_O6iUOtQS2-zgaD8GqnMSw",,,,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=701383405028328
,,8.68963E+14,2.68607E+14,the voice,Voice of the Martyrs Australia,"During this episode of Closer to the Fire, host Greg Musselman is joined by Rev. Nitin Sardar, who presently serves as the Director of Dinabandhu Ministries in central India. 

Rev. Sardar addresses the intensifying attacks on Indian followers of Jesus and discusses recent video footage showing violence against believers in Chhattisgarh State.

In the midst of these growing dangers, together with the anti-conversion laws being used to target non-Hindus across the country, Rev. Sardar explains how it is becoming increasingly difficult for Christians to share the Gospel and carry out humanitarian work.

As your elected member, I will push for independent funding of the regulatory bodies that oversee ethical behaviour in parliament.

Van Badham and Ben Davison look at how Dutton is playing politics over The Voice to parliament, why he's playing a politically dangerous game and just how easy it is to find ""the detail"" he claims he cannot find.  (Ben reads it out if you're interested Peter)

Turns out gas appliances aren't great for our health, our environment or our wallets but, as culture war correspondent Van Badham reports, there's enough vested interests to keep American law makers and ridiculous sky news types ranting about why pumping gas that makes unwell directly into your home should be a right.

With workplace law changes meaning more workers than ever will be able to get the benefits of union negotiated and won pay agreements the debate about ""free riders"" has started.  Many union leaders from sectors as diverse as childcare and the rail industry, healthcare and manufacturing are calling for changes to the law to allow for union won pay rises to include a fee for the service that non-members would have to pay.  Van and Ben discuss the idea, where it has come from and how Australia has ended up with huge numbers of people getting benefits they aren't paying for at the moment.  

You can join your union anytime at australianunions.org.au/wow to make sure your workplace has the resources needed to win better pay and conditions.

,,4.54185E+14,1.00362E+14,the voice,Vote 1 - Greens for Riverstone,"Hi! I‚Äôm Rob Vail.

I‚Äôm running because the community needs a strong, lifelong advocate for action to bring climate change under control and  push for public education and healthcare to have the attention that they need. 

Until my retirement in 2014, I was a public-school teacher. I spent 30 of my 35 years of service at Quakers Hill Public School. While in the workforce, I was a committed unionist with the NSW Teachers Federation, culminating in 4 years as President of Blacktown Teachers Association.

To volunteer, please head to my webpage at https://greens.org.au/nsw/person/rob-vail . Together we can:

(1) Reduce the impact of climate change by encouraging light-coloured roofs with solar panels and preventing overdevelopment, especially housing development on flood-prone land in Schofields & Riverstone.

(2) Make public education a major priority from early childhood through primary & secondary school to TAFE & university, with modern classrooms replacing demountables, the public-sector wage cap gone, and teachers better treated.

(3) Address the problems in our public healthcare system, with better working conditions for nurses, better healing conditions for patients, and better pay for hospital and ambulance service staff.

(4) Provide NSW residents with safe, toll-free roads and more affordable and social housing;

(5) Deliver a treaty and a voice for First Australians.

I‚Äôll represent our community‚Äôs values in the NSW Parliament and try to keep the major parties honest. Together, we can act on climate change & build a better future for our children.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen your comment regarding the current crime issues and they‚Äôre quite refreshing to hear. As a current QPS member, things aren‚Äôt great. On the frontline - since the Labor government has taken over, we‚Äôre busier, have less resources and our powers have been reduced. Offenders, especially juveniles literally taunt us and laugh in our faces. We spend hours per shift sitting around with juveniles, waiting for carer‚Äôs or driving them home even after they‚Äôve been found breaching bail, curfews, as well as armed with weapons. Police work extremely hard only to have the system let victims down and put the public at risk. How is one persons rights worth more than an entire populations?!

Prepare for a year of gaslighting, in which you will be told that the only way to ""Close the Gap"" is:

1) Vote YES, as directed by the gov't, unions, media, big business, and the grievance industry, pushed with $75M of your money.

2) They will then decide what YES means

3) Aboriginal Australians and Bruce Pascoe will have a free and fair race-based election

4) The results of the free election will be equal male and female, etc etc - ""The Voice"".

5) ""The Voice"" will come up with ""The Advice""

6) ""The Advice"" will be sent to the gov't

7) They will then ""Close the Gap""

It is hard to imagine a more expensive waste of time! 

We already have an Aboriginal ""Minister for Indigenous Australians"", with 10 other Aboriginal Australians in Parliament (elected in the normal, non-racist way).

They are already able to seek and receive ""advice"" from every Aboriginal person, organization and community in the nation. Why would 24 elected activists know any better, about what ""advice"" to give?

There are currently 25 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander MPs elected to the State and Federal Parliaments across Australia.  That‚Äôs 3.0% of ALL 832 State and Federal MPs.  ATSI peoples make up 3.8% of the Australian population.  

If we look at the LOWER HOUSES of Parliament, ATSI representation is LOW at the Federal level.  Only 3 of the 151 lower house seats in Federal Parliament are held by ATSI MPs or 2.0%.  It‚Äôs only marginally better in the lower hoses of State Parliament with 12 of the 455 seats (2.6%) being held by ATSI MPs ‚Ä¶ almost half of these are in NT alone!  If you remove NT, only 7 of 430 State seats are held by ATSI MPs (1.6%).  It might appear that work needs to be done at both the Federal and State level to address ATSI representation in the Lower Houses of our Parliaments.

Looking at the UPPER HOUSES of Parliament, we see a solid representation of ATSI Senators at the Federal level ‚Ä¶ being 8 of the 76 senators (10.5%).  But ‚Ä¶ at the State level, only 2 of the 155 Legislative Council positions are held by ATSI MPs or 1.3%. 

Lets not forget the 128 NSW Councils ‚Ä¶ 107 NSW Councils have no ATSI Councillors.  Based on 2021 data, there were 25 ATSI Councillors or 1.9% of the 1,293 Councillors in NSW.  

There were only 2 ATSI Councillors of the 412 Councillors across Greater Sydney.  In fact, 32 of the 34 Councils in greater Sydney do not have an ATSI Councillor.  Inner-city Councils such as Sydney, Inner West, Burwood, Strathfield and Canada Bay all reported no ATSI Councillors.

In 2021, a total of 23 or 92% of ATSI Councillors in NSW were outside Sydney; in rural areas or regional centres.  

There appears to be some work that needs to be done in the area of local representation for ATSI peoples on NSW Councils.

Ben looks at how the dysfunctional Republican Party took a record number of ballots to finally elect the only candidate they had for speaker and why the next two years may be ungovernable for the Party that once saw itself as the ""natural party of government"".

Peter Dutton has kicked on 2023 behind in the polls and desperate to find a pathway into government.  
Today's press conference on The Voice was a classic polyphonic speech, talking to multiple audiences with a different set of meanings.  It was crass, it was disingenuous, it displayed how he remains beholden to far right ideologues and it had a touch of cooker sprinkled into the middle.

Ben breaks down why this double speak will fail to win back the Menzian centre right and further entrenches people's distrust of Dutton and his conservative rump.

Some families may be forced to travel to Melbourne for maternity care.  

I will be raising this issue as soon as Parliament resumes in early February directly with the States Health Minister.

Already we have:

Made child care cheaper for 1.2 million Australian families, making it easier to parents to return to work and save money. 

We have built a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. The Commission will investigate corrupt conduct across the entire federal public sector and it will restore trust and integrity to federal politics. 

On climate change, we have legislated a net zero target by 2050, and forty three per cent by 2030 and we started work on securing our renewable energy future. 

That includes cheaper electric vehicles, rewiring the nation to support renewables  and the installation of 400 community batteries across Australia ‚Äì  including in Bayswater and Dianella. 

And we are rebuilding our international relationships, so Australia is treated seriously on the world stage.

We hosted the Jobs and Skills summit, and as a result, worked to correct ten years of stagnant wage growth and made gender equity an object of the Fair Work Act.

We have abolished the Cashless Debit Card.

We started the Royal Commission into Robodebt.

We made 24/7 registered nurses at aged care facilities the law. 

We expanded paid parental leave to six months. 

We have delivered 465,000 fee-free TAFE places to fix our skills crisis.

And provided an extra 20,000 university places.

,,3.45042E+15,1.00293E+14,the voice,Hawkesbury Matters,"Since our first post in June 2021, HM has tried to advocate for the people of the Hawkesbury making our local, state and federal government aware of the issues and concerns through community journalism and political noise.

We‚Äôve covered the planning mess of the ‚Äúthird crossing‚Äù, the secret world of property development in the valley, the Hawkesbury‚Äôs burgeoning casino business, the politicisation of floods, roads, urban heat and koalas, government incompetence, broken promises and lies. 

You are the judge of our success or otherwise. And while we try our best to raise issues we think are important, it is the communities voice that amplifies these matters to make our political representatives sit up and listen. Let‚Äôs not forget they are elected by us to represent us.

Without your engagement in the matters you care about we at HM simply wouldn‚Äôt exist and our politicians would have one less protagonist banging on their door.

Not everyone likes the issues we are raising or what we are saying. Since we began the Mayor has threatened to sicc the Government‚Äôs secret police ‚Äì the Fixated Persons Unit onto us. She later sent us a series of legal letters, threatening to sue us for defamation.

At the local council elections late last year the HM ute ‚Äì displaying signs to ban property developers from council - was smashed by criminals. In the past two months an Enforcement Officer from Hawkesbury City Council has twice visited HM‚Äôs home to tell them their 30 year old house is an illegal dwelling. The officer was apparently acting upon a complaint.

In spite of these sideshows our promise to you is that we will continue to fight the good fight without fear or favour.
We‚Äôve got a big year coming up next year and we ain‚Äôt going anywhere.

To kick off 2023 we‚Äôve got the March 2023 State election and then later in the year the Hawkesbury Council election. Two great opportunities to vote your elected representatives out of office if you don‚Äôt think they are working in your interests.

Other key issues for 2023 will be climate change, urban squalor, over development. The state government‚Äôs negligent policy to continue unbridled development of the floodplain placing thousands of lives at risk will be squarely in our sights.

Whether you care about trees and koala‚Äôs or not, there are some big market driven changes heading our way in 2023 and they are going to have a substantial impact on Hawkesbury house values and the way we live and behave. The perennial issues of our substandard roads, the rapidly escalating daily traffic congestion, flood preparedness and protection, the vanishing rural environment and making sure our local businesses are protected will also be a key focus for HM.

So today, almost two years on we at HM would like to say thank you to the Hawkesbury Community. Thank you for your continued support and engagement. We will continue to raise the issues we think you want raised, we will continue to shine the spotlight on corruption, misinformation and lies and we‚Äôll continue to fight to protect the Hawkesbury Valley because simply, we think its worth protecting.

,,5.78215E+15,1.31284E+14,the voice,Australian Jewish Association - AJA,"AJA PUBLISHED IN THE AUSTRALIAN NEWSPAPER 

AJA Public Affairs Director Robert Gregory was published in today's Australian print newspaper. The Australian is distributed nationally and has a very wide reach. 

Robert's article appears prominently on the Australian newspaper website and has attracted a significant response in the comments section. 

AJA has been the leading Jewish organisation in Australia in calling out the oppression of the Uighur people by the Chinese Communist party. This has not been without consequences. 

AJA takes the lesson of 'never Again' from the Holocaust very seriously. 

While we will never waiver from our core mission of advocating for the Australian Jewish Community and Israel, which occupies 99.9% of our time, we are proud to provide a voice to those who don't have the same access that we do. 

Read the article online or below: 

https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/as-a-jew-i-cant-stay-silent-on-persecution-of-chinas-muslims/news-story/0a6aafc2fb79513fc80449fba529a7ee

AS A JEW, I CAN'T STAY SILENT ON PERSECUTION OF CHINA'S MUSLIMS 

As a Jew, I cannot stay silent while Muslims face the religious persecution my people know so well.

As analysts and policy wonks debate the recent ‚Äútremendous reset‚Äù between Anthony Albanese and Chinese president for life Xi Jinping and the meaning of Penny Wong‚Äôs recent trip to Beijing, an important question is ignored. Are closer China relations something Australia should aspire to at this time?

Many experts assert that China is committing genocide against its Uighur Muslim population. More than one million Uighurs are held in re-education camps, including young children separated from their parents. The detainees are forcibly indoctrinated with Chinese Communist Party propaganda and forbidden from speaking their language.

Uighur women claim they are forced to have abortions and undergo sterilisation. Statistics show that in 2014, Xinjiang ‚Äì the province where Uighurs live ‚Äì accounted for 2.5 per cent of intra-uterine device placements. Just four years later that had skyrocketed to 80 per cent of China‚Äôs IUD placements. (Xinjiang makes up 1.8 per cent of China‚Äôs population.)

I recently attended a beautiful Uighur wedding. The groom‚Äôs parents were unable to attend because China wouldn‚Äôt let them leave. Several guests told heart-wrenching stories. One man told me that the last time he spoke to his mother, she asked him not to phone again as phone calls with the West could get her detained. That was in 2017 and he hadn‚Äôt heard from her since. Another young man said that when his wife returned to China for a visit, she was sentenced to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment for studying overseas. She was pregnant with his unborn child.

Growing up in the shadow of the Holocaust, with a grandmother who survived Auschwitz, I have always resisted conflating the Holocaust. Holocaust comparisons are generally inaccurate and don‚Äôt help further one‚Äôs case. The Holocaust stands alone in its calculated brutality. The project to annihilate an entire race was devised in ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù Germany and assisted by willing collaborators spanning the breadth of Europe.

That said, certain parallels are hard to overlook. Tonnes of shaved Uighur hair for sale, concentration camps, systematic destruction of places of worship, allegations of medical experimentation, slave labour and bans on religious Muslims growing beards all evoke aspects of humanity‚Äôs darkest hour.

The Holocaust bestowed Jews with a special responsibility to speak out on behalf of those facing religious and racial persecution. The Australian Jewish Association has hosted Uighur speakers, addressed Uighur rallies, made submissions to government and worked to raise awareness. Overseas, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has sounded the alarm, warning the ‚ÄúChinese government may be committing genocide against the Uighurs‚Äù. The American Jewish Committee has urged President Joe Biden to take action.

I‚Äôm not naive. I know there isn‚Äôt a single country without human rights concerns. Even Western nations have their issues. Obviously, Australia can‚Äôt cut itself off from every country engaged in human rights abuses, but there is a line ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a matter of where it‚Äôs drawn.

This year the West drew that line at invading a neighbouring European country. Russia has been made a pariah and rightfully so. Our Prime Minister almost certainly would decline a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Likewise, Australian business leaders would run a mile. In fact, Australian companies have severed all business connections with Russia.

In contrast, Australia‚Äôs desire not to rock the boat with China has caused embarrassing scenes. A Uighur delegation, including concentration camp survivors who reported experiencing torture and forced sterilisation, vis¬≠ited Canberra recently and were declined a meeting with Wong.

So why the discrepancy? Our business ties with Russia were minuscule. Severing them imposed no real cost to Australia.

Were Australia to take meaningful steps against China, the economic fallout has the potential to plunge us into recession. China has shown it‚Äôs not averse to using economic blackmail to bully Australia. There was talk last year about banning goods produced by Uighur slave labour, a seeming no-brainer, but the bill never passed. Instead, Australia‚Äôs trade with China‚Äôs Uighur province has increased including solar panels and cotton.

To be fair, Australia has spoken out at the UN. Shamefully, China sits on the UN Human Rights Council and has stymied all action.

I don‚Äôt pretend to have the answers but I know Australia can‚Äôt carry on like ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù. The line must be drawn somewhere. If it isn‚Äôt Tibet, Taiwan or Hong Kong, then surely concentration camps and allegations of organ harvesting cross Australia‚Äôs line. Decoupling our economy from China has been spoken about in a national security context and banning goods produced by slave labour seems like a good place to start. Recognising China‚Äôs actions as genocide is another.

I can‚Äôt predict what the Foreign Minister‚Äôs China visit means for Sino-Australian ties, but one thing is clear to me. As a Jew, I will continue to speak out for Uighur Muslims. I can‚Äôt stay silent.

In remote Communities across Australia there is often no infrastructure such as libraries or bookstores. Access to reading material is extremely limited and this impacts the achievements of Indigenous children.

The Indigenous Literacy Foundation's Book Supply program meets this need by providing new, culturally relevant books to up to 400 remote Communities across Australia.

Over 50% of books in the Book Supply packs feature Indigenous authors and illustrators. This is important as it allows kids to see themselves and their culture reflected in the stories, helping to build a sense of connection, belonging and pride.

This Festive Season, we're asking Australians to add a book for a First Nations child to their giving  list.

Since the greyhound industry was exposed with shocking footage on national TV, nothing has changed.

The Animal Justice Party will never give up. But we can‚Äôt do it without people like you.

We need you in our corner to strengthen our voice in the NSW parliament and remind the government that animals matter. That‚Äôs why we are asking you to join us today.

By becoming a member of the Animal Justice Party, you will give a voice to greyhounds and all the other animals that are exploited for greed and profit.

The major parties backed down from saving thousands of animals from this cruel and unnecessary industry, an industry that abuses animals and fuels gambling. Could there be a worse combination?

Will you join the Animal Justice Party and give animals a voice?

Enough is enough. Stand for the voiceless today.
