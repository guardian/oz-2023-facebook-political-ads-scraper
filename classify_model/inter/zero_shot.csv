3400893813496110,104180525925926,other,"The proposed Voice is a direct threat to our democracy and the Constitution.

This referendum divides Australians by race, gives one small group of Australians an extra say over Parliament and the Government, and will cost the earth.

And to top it off, the dangerous and divisive Voice is a “first step” towards Treaty and “agreement making”.

That could mean reparations, a “black parliament”, and oversight of executive government and the public service. 

Meanwhile there’s a crime crisis in Alice Springs, along with an energy and cost of living crisis that’s just going to get worse.

It’s not right and it’s not fair.

But you can help fight back now by signing this pledge, telling Anthony Albanese you’ll vote ‘NO!’.

The referendum is coming – and those driving a divided Australia are already off and running.

This referendum divides Australians by race, gives one small group of Australians an extra say over Parliament and the Government, and will cost the earth.

And to top it off, the dangerous and divisive Voice is a “first step” towards Treaty and “agreement making”.

That could mean reparations, a “black parliament”, and oversight of executive government and the public service. 

Meanwhile there’s a crime crisis in Alice Springs, along with an energy and cost of living crisis that’s just going to get worse.

It’s not right and it’s not fair.

This referendum divides Australians by race, gives one small group of Australians an extra say over Parliament and the Government, and will cost the earth.

And to top it off, the dangerous and divisive Voice is a “first step” towards Treaty and “agreement making”.

That could mean reparations, a “black parliament”, and oversight of executive government and the public service. 

Meanwhile there’s a crime crisis in Alice Springs, along with an energy and cost of living crisis that’s just going to get worse.

It’s not right and it’s not fair.

But you can help fight back now by signing this pledge, telling Anthony Albanese you’ll vote ‘NO!’.

The referendum is coming – and those driving a divided Australia are already off and running.

So it’s urgent to take action now to oppose it.
