The Australian is distributed nationally and has a very wide reach. \\n\\nRobert's article appears prominently on the Australian newspaper website and has attracted a significant response in the comments section. \\n\\nAJA has been the leading Jewish organisation in Australia in calling out the oppression of the Uighur people by the Chinese Communist party. This has not been without consequences. \\n\\nAJA takes the lesson of 'never Again' from the Holocaust very seriously. \\n\\nWhile we will never waiver from our core mission of advocating for the Australian Jewish Community and Israel, which occupies 99.9% of our time, we are proud to provide a voice to those who don't have the same access that we do. \\n\\nRead the article online or below: \\n\\nhttps://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/as-a-jew-i-cant-stay-silent-on-persecution-of-chinas-muslims/news-story/0a6aafc2fb79513fc80449fba529a7ee\\n\\nAS A JEW, I CAN'T STAY SILENT ON PERSECUTION OF CHINA'S MUSLIMS \\n\\nAs a Jew, I cannot stay silent while Muslims face the religious persecution my people know so well.\\n\\nAs analysts and policy wonks debate the recent ‚Äútremendous reset‚Äù between Anthony Albanese and Chinese president for life Xi Jinping and the meaning of Penny Wong‚Äôs recent trip to Beijing, an important question is ignored. Are closer China relations something Australia should aspire to at this time?\\n\\nMany experts assert that China is committing genocide against its Uighur Muslim population. More than one million Uighurs are held in re-education camps, including young children separated from their parents. The detainees are forcibly indoctrinated with Chinese Communist Party propaganda and forbidden from speaking their language.\\n\\nUighur women claim they are forced to have abortions and undergo sterilisation. Statistics show that in 2014, Xinjiang ‚Äì the province where Uighurs live ‚Äì accounted for 2.5 per cent of intra-uterine device placements. Just four years later that had skyrocketed to 80 per cent of China‚Äôs IUD placements. (Xinjiang makes up 1.8 per cent of China‚Äôs population.)\\n\\nI recently attended a beautiful Uighur wedding. The groom‚Äôs parents were unable to attend because China wouldn‚Äôt let them leave. Several guests told heart-wrenching stories. One man told me that the last time he spoke to his mother, she asked him not to phone again as phone calls with the West could get her detained. That was in 2017 and he hadn‚Äôt heard from her since. Another young man said that when his wife returned to China for a visit, she was sentenced to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment for studying overseas. She was pregnant with his unborn child.\\n\\nGrowing up in the shadow of the Holocaust, with a grandmother who survived Auschwitz, I have always resisted conflating the Holocaust. Holocaust comparisons are generally inaccurate and don‚Äôt help further one‚Äôs case. The Holocaust stands alone in its calculated brutality. The project to annihilate an entire race was devised in ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù Germany and assisted by willing collaborators spanning the breadth of Europe.\\n\\nThat said, certain parallels are hard to overlook. Tonnes of shaved Uighur hair for sale, concentration camps, systematic destruction of places of worship, allegations of medical experimentation, slave labour and bans on religious Muslims growing beards all evoke aspects of humanity‚Äôs darkest hour.\\n\\nThe Holocaust bestowed Jews with a special responsibility to speak out on behalf of those facing religious and racial persecution. The Australian Jewish Association has hosted Uighur speakers, addressed Uighur rallies, made submissions to government and worked to raise awareness. Overseas, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has sounded the alarm, warning the ‚ÄúChinese government may be committing genocide against the Uighurs‚Äù. The American Jewish Committee has urged President Joe Biden to take action.\\n\\nI‚Äôm not naive. I know there isn‚Äôt a single country without human rights concerns. Even Western nations have their issues. Obviously, Australia can‚Äôt cut itself off from every country engaged in human rights abuses, but there is a line ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a matter of where it‚Äôs drawn.\\n\\nThis year the West drew that line at invading a neighbouring European country. Russia has been made a pariah and rightfully so. Our Prime Minister almost certainly would decline a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Likewise, Australian business leaders would run a mile. In fact, Australian companies have severed all business connections with Russia.\\n\\nIn contrast, Australia‚Äôs desire not to rock the boat with China has caused embarrassing scenes. A Uighur delegation, including concentration camp survivors who reported experiencing torture and forced sterilisation, vis¬≠ited Canberra recently and were declined a meeting with Wong.\\n\\nSo why the discrepancy? Our business ties with Russia were minuscule. Severing them imposed no real cost to Australia.\\n\\nWere Australia to take meaningful steps against China, the economic fallout has the potential to plunge us into recession. China has shown it‚Äôs not averse to using economic blackmail to bully Australia. There was talk last year about banning goods produced by Uighur slave labour, a seeming no-brainer, but the bill never passed. Instead, Australia‚Äôs trade with China‚Äôs Uighur province has increased including solar panels and cotton.\\n\\nTo be fair, Australia has spoken out at the UN. Shamefully, China sits on the UN Human Rights Council and has stymied all action.\\n\\nI don‚Äôt pretend to have the answers but I know Australia can‚Äôt carry on like ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù. The line must be drawn somewhere. If it isn‚Äôt Tibet, Taiwan or Hong Kong, then surely concentration camps and allegations of organ harvesting cross Australia‚Äôs line. Decoupling our economy from China has been spoken about in a national security context and banning goods produced by slave labour seems like a good place to start. Recognising China‚Äôs actions as genocide is another.\\n\\nI can‚Äôt predict what the Foreign Minister‚Äôs China visit means for Sino-Australian ties, but one thing is clear to me. As a Jew, I will continue to speak out for Uighur Muslims. I can‚Äôt stay silent.\\n\\nRobert Gregory is director of public affairs at the Australian Jewish Association.\"}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Australia‚Äôs environment laws are being rewritten for the first time in over 20 years.

But before her hands could touch Michael Lucas, he pushed her away cruelly.\\n\"Don\\'t touch me!\" Michael\\'s cold voice was filled with contemptuous rejection.\\nWendy stumbled backward. Her collision with the edge of the table halted her momentum.\\nMichael approached her. He reached out, wrapping his hand around Wendy\\'s neck. With a dark smile, he asked, \"Do you agree to this divorce?\"\\nWendy found it difficult to talk when she was being strangled. She managed to choke out, \"I... do not.\"\\n\"You do not?\" Michael\\'s smile grew even colder as he tightened his grip around her neck.\\nFollowing that action, he pushed Wendy onto the table and informed her coldly, \"In that case, you have to fulfill your obligation to me as my wife ...\"\\nWendy gripped the edges of the table forcefully and could only passively put up with everything that was happening.\\nAfter some time, Michael finally decided to spare her.\\nHe walked over to the edge of the bed, pulled open the bedside drawer, and took out a pill. Tossing it onto Wendy\\'s body, he instructed her in his usual icy cold tone, \"Swallow it.\"\\nThe pill first landed on Wendy\\'s body before falling onto the ground.\\nShe gazed at the pill lying on the floor. Lowering her head, Wendy squatted down and picked it up slowly.\\nPicking up the pill, Wendy hesitated for a moment before putting it in her mouth.\\nMichael left after watching Wendy consume the pill.\\nWendy waited until Michael had completely disappeared from her vision before she spat out the pill in her mouth.\\nStaring at the tiny pill, Wendy laughed bitterly, and then she started to cry quietly.\\nShe had never dared to cry in front of Michael.\\nAfter all, Michael had once told her that he hated it when she cried, that he hated looking at her sad face.\\nThe following day, Wendy went to work at MC Enterprise on time as if nothing happened.\\nMC Enterprise was the biggest company in Lake City and Michael Lucas was the president there. Wendy happened to be his personal assistant.\\nMichael\\'s cold voice drifted to her ears the moment she entered the president\\'s office.\\nHe said, \"This is the third time that you are late this month. Your bonus salary has been completely deducted.\"\\nWendy bowed her head slightly and replied, \"In that case, you can dock my pay.\"\\nThe truth was that Wendy had not arrived late at all. This was just Michael looking for an excuse to deduct her pay.\\nWithout raising his head, Michael said, \"You can quit if you have any opinions about it.\"\\n\"I don\\'t have any opinions,\" replied Wendy as she blinked. \"Let me prepare some coffee for you.\"\\nAfter preparing the coffee, Wendy served it to Michael.\\nShe had just reached his office door when she heard Yvonne\\'s voice.\\nYvonne Taylor was the woman that Michael had loved for four years. Because of Yvonne, Wendy had been reduced to a cunning and unscrupulous woman in Michael\\'s eyes.\\nMichael had once warned Wendy that the only thing he could give her was a marriage certificate. The only reason she was able to join his company was because of pressure from his grandmother.\\nShe was instructed to avoid Yvonne whenever that woman appeared at the company. The consequence for not adhering to that was Wendy\\'s departure from MC Enterprise.\\nWendy was afraid to disobey.\\nJust as Wendy was about to head to the lounge to avoid Yvonne, she heard the latter say, \"Michael, you\\'ve finally agreed to let me join the company as your assistant. I\\'m overjoyed.\"\\nWendy heard Michael acknowledge those words.\\nThis made Wendy instantly stop in her tracks. Her hands, which were wrapped around the cup of coffee, started trembling.\\nWendy entered the office and grew agitated before Michael, which was a rare occurrence. \"I don\\'t approve of that!\" she said.\\nMichael shot Wendy a disgruntled look, replying in a cold voice, \"What right do you have to disagree?\"\\nWendy said, \"Michael, you promised me.\"\\n\"I did promise you, but it\\'s been three years. Some things should have changed a long time ago,\" replied Michael coldly. \"You don\\'t get any say in the company\\'s affairs.\"\\n\"Grandmother would never agree to it. Aren\\'t you afraid of angering her?\" For Wendy, Michael\\'s grandmother was the only bargaining chip she possessed.\\nWhen Michael heard those words, his face instantly darkened. \"Wendy Stewart, you keep dragging my grandmother into the picture. Haven\\'t you had enough? Let me warn you, don\\'t try to use my grandmother to pressure me. If you feel as though you can\\'t stay in this company, the HR department is on the fifth story.\"\\nThis was Michael\\'s ultimate weapon. No matter what happened, if Michael threatened her with divorce or resignation, Wendy found herself unable to do anything except grit her teeth and put up with it all.\\n***\\nNews of Yvonne Taylor\\'s new position of assistant to the president of MC Enterprise spread like wildfire throughout the company that very afternoon.\\nIt was well known within the company that Yvonne was Michael\\'s girlfriend.\\nInitially, Michael wanted to arrange for Yvonne to have a separate office. However, Yvonne claimed that she was coming here to work and said that it was best if they followed the company\\'s rules.\\nConsequently, it was only natural that Yvonne and Wendy started sharing the same office space.\\nYvonne approached Wendy with a smile. She said, \"Wendy Stewart, you resorted to despicable means to steal Michael from me three years ago and plotted to get married to him.\"\\n\"But how are things going for you now?\"\\n\"The entire company, no, in fact, everyone in Lake City knows that I am his real girlfriend.\"\\n\"If you\\'re smart, you should leave Michael of your own accord.\"\\n\"Otherwise, don\\'t blame me for being nasty.\"\\n\"This is the president\\'s work schedule for this week. I\\'ve already flagged out the important clients for you. Since you\\'re now his assistant, you should do what you need to do.\" Wendy handed Yvonne a document and continued, \"The first thing you should do upon arriving at the company every morning is to make a cup of coffee for the president. President Lucas likes his coffee without sugar, and you have to personally grind the coffee beans ...\"\\nWendy had not finished speaking when Yvonne slapped away the document she was holding. Yvonne retracted her smile.\\nHer voice filled with hatred as she said, \"Why are you so shameless? Michael does not love you at all, but you insist on clinging to him. Do you know that Michael always tells me how disgusted he feels when he sees you? I really don\\'t know how your parents raised you. You are just a vixen who specializes in stealing other people\\'s boyfriends!\"\\n\"Yvonne Taylor!\" Wendy stood up abruptly, slamming her hand heavily against the table. \"We both know very well exactly what happened three years ago.\"\\n\"So what if we know very well?\" Yvonne sneered. \"I\\'m sure you\\'ve tried to explain yourself to Michael many times over the past three years. If he wanted to believe you, it would have worked long ago.\"\\n\"Stop daydreaming! I am the person Michael loves. In his heart, you are just a vicious woman. See, I wanted to join the company and all had to do was tell him about it. He let me come to work the following day. You should know better than anyone where I stand in his heart. If you are smart, you should leave before it\\'s too late. Otherwise, I\\'ll make sure you meet with a horrible end!\"\\n\"Is that so? In that case, let\\'s just wait and see what happens,\" replied Wendy. She had endured everything for the past three years without getting divorced, there was no way that she would just back off just because Yvonne joined the company.\\nSuddenly, Yvonne shrieked and fell to the ground. Her tone immediately grew indignant as she said, \"Miss Stewart, I know you don\\'t like me and you never wanted me to join the company. However, all I wanted to do was stay by Michael\\'s side and help him alleviate some of his work problems ... I know you guys are married and I should not be doing this. But your marriage was a mistake in the first place, it was you who ... who ...\" Yvonne burst into tears.\\nWendy did not have to turn back to guess that Michael had probably stepped into the room.\\nIndeed, Michael took big strides forward. He squatted to help Yvonne up. His face was filled with anger as he gazed at Wendy. \"You should know that there is a limit to my tolerance.\"\\n\"Michael, please don\\'t blame Miss Stewart. She just wanted to chase me away. She doesn\\'t want me here,\" said Yvonne as she leaned heavily on Michael as if she had no backbone and was incapable of standing on her own.\\nWendy clenched her fists hidden beneath her sleeves.\\n\"There is a CCTV in this office. You can look at the footage to see for yourself what really happened earlier.\"\\nWendy knew Michael would never believe her words. The CCTV footage was the only way to let Michael learn about the truth.\\nUpon hearing those words, Yvonne\\'s eyes flashed, and she started crying harder.\\n\"Michael, I just wanted to work peacefully with Miss Stewart. After all, we are both your assistants. All I did was ask her about some work-related questions and requested for her guidance ... However, instead of helping me, she slapped my face with a document, and even pushed me ...\"\\nYvonne\\'s crying had reached its peak.\\nMichael comforted her while lecturing Wendy, \"If you dare bully Yvonne again, I\\'ll sure to teach you a lesson that even grandmother cannot interfere in.\"\\n\"Haha ...\" Wendy chuckled bitterly.\\nIndeed, Michael did not even want to check the CCTV footage.\\nHe believed everything Yvonne said.\\nChapter 2: Wake Up! Michael Doesn\\'t Love You\\nYvonne joined the company as Michael\\'s personal assistant but she had no actual responsibilities. All she did every day was wandering around the company, win over the hearts of her colleagues, and when it was time, have lunch with Michael.\\nJust as Michael had told her, all Yvonne had to do was look as pretty as a flower.\\nOf course, Yvonne also plotted to get Wendy in trouble.\\nThe only thing Wendy could do was put up with it.\\nIn the afternoon, Michael personally entered their office.\\n\"Michael.\" Upon seeing Michael, Yvonne instantly greeted him with a smile. \"Are you done with your meeting?\"\\n\"Yes, I am. I\\'m here to have lunch with you,\" Michael replied with a smile on his face. His arm wrapped around Yvonne\\'s waist smoothly. He completely ignored Wendy\\'s existence and led Yvonne past her, exiting the room.\\nWendy\\'s gaze trailed after their interlocked hands, her eyes unblinking.\\nNobody knew just how much misery she felt in her heart whenever Michael and Yvonne put up such a public display of affection in front of her.\\nWendy clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her skin. However, she felt nothing but numbness.\\nInhaling a deep breath, Wendy regulated her own emotions. She comforted herself quietly. After all, this was not the first time. What was the point of getting angry now?\\nShe thought, \\'if I cannot even put up with this, how can I continue working in this company?\\'\\nAs Wendy lowered her head to arrange the documents on the table, she caught sight of fresh blood dripping from her palms. Almost mechanically, she grabbed a piece of tissue to clean her wounds.\\nNot long after, Zen Tanner entered the office. He said, \"Wendy, I just found out that President Lucas deducted money from your salary again. Why didn\\'t you tell me that you have no money to eat? Come on, let\\'s go get some food.\"\\n\"I\\'m not hungry, and anyway, I\\'m trying to lose weight. I don\\'t want to eat. You can go ahead,\" said Wendy. The truth was, she was afraid of running into Yvonne and Michael at the cafeteria in the third story.\\n\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'re not hungry again. You haven\\'t been eating lunch for the past few days, have you? Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'ll end up starving your body? If that really happens, you\\'ll just be letting Yvonne win.\" Zen paid no attention to Wendy\\'s rejection. He grabbed her and walked out of the office.\\nWendy had no appetite, to begin with. However, Zen was right. She thought, \\'if l really fall sick from starving myself, I would be letting Yvonne win.\\'\\nShe followed Zen to the third story.\\nHalfway through their meal, Michael and Yvonne walked out of the private room.\\nWendy heard the people around her express their envy, but she did not have the courage to look up at the couple.\\nWhen Yvonne saw Wendy, her eyes flashed.\\nReleasing her grip on Michael, she approached Wendy with a smile. Yvonne took out a bracelet from her purse and handed it to her, saying, \"Miss Stewart, I have a gift for you ... I wanted to give this to you previously as well, but you refused to accept it. This time, I hope that you will accept it in front of everybody. In the future, let\\'s work hard together and help Michael, okay?\"\\nYvonne had never tried to give Wendy any gifts. Her words were only meant for the people around them to hear, to highlight her generosity and Wendy\\'s pettiness.\\n\"I don\\'t need it,\" Wendy rejected her coldly.\\nShe thought, \\'why would I possibly accept anything from Yvonne?\\'\\nWhen she looked up, she saw delight swimming in Yvonne\\'s eyes.\\nIndeed, everyone around them was talking about her.\\nSomeone said, \"Wendy Stewart really doesn\\'t know where she stands.\"\\nAnother person added, \"How dare she act so arrogant when Miss Taylor is personally offering her a gift?\"\\n\"Miss Taylor is the president\\'s real girlfriend. Where does Wendy get her guts from? really respect her.\"\\n\"Indeed, the whole company knows what she\\'s up to. I really don\\'t know how such a shameless woman can exist in this world.\"\\n\"I heard that Wendy Stewart threatened Yvonne Taylor on her first day here. I really don\\'t know where she got the courage to act like that.\"\\n....\\n\"Miss Stewart, are you saying you don\\'t want to work harmoniously with me?\"\\nYvonne\\'s tone quickly turned indignant. She continued, \"I know that you detest me, but I just want to do my job well.\"\\nWendy thought, \\'she wants to do her job well?\\'\\nShe wanted to laugh.\\nHas Yvonne even done anything at all over the past few days?\\nYvonne schemed endlessly to enter the company, all because she wanted to always remain at Michael\\'s side.\\nJust like ... Wendy herself.\\nWendy did not have a good reputation in the company. She did not care and could not be bothered to explain herself.\\nLowering her head, Wendy continued eating the rice in her bowl.\\nZen could not continue watching this. He stood up. But before he could say anything, he was held back by Wendy. \"It\\'s not necessary,\" she said.\\nWendy knew that Zen was doing this for her good.\\nHowever, she worked at MC Enterprise where Michael was the president of the company. On top of that, Yvonne had gotten a job as his assistant. If Zen tried to stand up for Wendy right now, even if he did not get fired immediately, he would have a hard time in the company.\\nAs Michael observed Wendy\\'s indifference, anger rose in his chest.\\nHe thought that this woman really did not know any better.\\nMichael stepped forward. He took the bracelet on the table and turned around, pulling Yvonne with him. In a cold voice, he said, \"She\\'s not worthy of such an expensive gift.\"\\nYvonne turned her head to glance at Wendy and made sure she was loud enough to be overheard by the latter when she spoke, \"I know I shouldn\\'t give away the bracelet that you bought for me, Michael, but I really had nothing but good intentions. I just want to remain in the company and be able to stay by your side.\"\\nHold on ...\\nWendy thought, \\'that bracelet was a gift from Michael?\\'\\nWendy inhaled deeply.\\nIn the past three years of their marriage, Michael had never given her anything-not even a flower petal, much less a bracelet.\\nToday, however, Yvonne was about to give her a bracelet that Michael had bought for her.\\nShe knew Yvonne did it on purpose.\\nWendy did not hear a single word of Michael\\'s subsequent response.\\n\"Wendy, your palms are bleeding!\" Zen called Wendy\\'s name several times but he failed to get her to return to her senses.\\nSeeing that she was injured, Zen quickly unfurled her fists and saw blood dripping from her palms.\\nThe wounds were a result of Wendy\\'s nails digging deep into her flesh.\\nWendy came to her senses and immediately retracted her hands. \"Let\\'s get back to work now that we\\'ve finished our meal.\" With that, Wendy stood up and left.\\nFeeling worried about Wendy, Zen quickly trailed after her. \"Wendy, please don\\'t scare me. You\\'re bleeding so much. Let me go back to the office with you and bandage your wounds,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m fine, just ignore me,\" said Wendy. She had long grown numb to the pain.\\n\"How can you possibly be fine?\" asked Zen. \"I know that you\\'re upset, you can cry or talk to me, but please don\\'t suppress your emotions.\"\\n\"I\\'m really fine,\" Wendy repeated.\\nLooking at Wendy\\'s soulless appearance, Zen felt worried and angry at the same time.\\nSensing no intention on Wendy\\'s part to stop walking, Zen shouted loudly, \"Wendy Stewart!\"\\nThe sudden loudness of his voice made Wendy stop in her tracks momentarily. Zen sneered at her from behind. \"Can you take a look at what you\\'ve turned into? ... In the past three years, you have grown submissive and relenting.\"\\n\"You used to be high-spirited, proud, and confident. You were the most attractive girl in our school. Half of the male student population wanted to woo you. You were also the most outstanding student in our school-you was praised by the teachers and were a role model for the other students. Back then, you said that you wanted to become the brightest star in the design industry. You wanted to stand on the international stage and shine radiantly ... You were clearly the bright moon, but for a man like this, you turned into a grain of dust.\"\\n\"You gave up on design, gave up on your dreams, and instead chose to stay beside Michael, making coffee for him every day!\"\\n\"Wendy Stewart, when will you wake up? Michael doesn\\'t love you, why do you devalue yourself like this?\"\\nChapter 3: Something Felt Fishy\\nZen\\'s words replayed in Wendy\\'s mind.\\nIndeed, Michael did not love her.\\nHowever, the first time she laid eyes on Michael, she had already lost herself. How could she possibly let go of three years of obsession?\\nWhen she returned to the office, Wendy witnessed Yvonne feeding Michael some sliced fruits. The smiles on their faces made her eyes sting.\\nThey could have gone to the president\\'s office to behave intimately, yet they deliberately chose to remain in the assistant\\'s office.\\nMore blood trickled down Wendy\\'s palms, hidden beneath her sleeves.\\nWhen Yvonne saw Wendy coming in, she said with a smile, \"Miss Stewart, it\\'s currently still lunchtime. Michael and intend to rest on the couch, why don\\'t you go hang out in the lounge for a while?\"\\n\"This is my office,\" said Wendy and she remained where she was without moving.\\nYvonne was obviously the guest in this office, yet she continued acting as though she owned the space.\\nYvonne grabbed Michael\\'s hand and started whining unhappily, \"Michael.\"\\nMichael lifted his head. He regarded Wendy with raised eyebrows, his face displeased. \"I own this entire company, you have to go wherever I tell you to go. If you don\\'t wish to work here anymore ...\"\\nBefore Michael could finish speaking, Wendy finally lost her temper. She said, \"Michael, is this the only thing you can threaten me with? Back then, you promised me that I could join the company and that you would not fire me if I did not leave voluntarily. In exchange, I would not appear before you and Yvonne whenever she came to the company. Now that she is working here as your assistant, I want you to agree to another condition.\"\\n\"Wendy Stewart, when did you become so obstinate?\" Michael could not help giving Wendy another glance as he observed the anger on her face.\\nHe thought, \\'this woman has never dared to disobey me. Now, she\\'s negotiating with me?\\'\\n\"I know you detest me and l cannot do anything about you wanting to bring Yvonne into the company. However, both of you are forbidden from public displays of affection before me. Otherwise, I will ...\"\\nBefore Wendy could finish speaking, Michael snorted. \"Otherwise? You\\'re probably just going to complain to my grandmother.\"\\n\"You\\'re absolutely right,\" said Wendy. At those words, she whipped out her mobile phone and stared directly at Michael. \"If you don\\'t agree to my condition, I\\'ll call your grandmother right now and tell her that you gave Yvonne a job in the company.\"\\nMichael gazed at Wendy\\'s hands and frowned lightly, feeling surprised about her injury.\\nHowever, he felt nothing but disgust and hatred toward Wendy. Naturally, he did not care that she was hurt.\\n\"Michael ...\" Yvonne was afraid that Michael would agree just like that. She said coquettishly, \"I just want to hang out with you for a little longer.\"\\nThe atmosphere had grown really tense.\\nAll three individuals in the office were silent. The entire space was alarmingly quiet.\\nThis was the first time that Wendy was negotiating with Michael so bravely.\\nAs his wife, her condition was for them to stop behaving intimately before her eyes. However, she was terrified. She was afraid that Michael would chase her out of the company in a moment of anger and insist on getting divorced.\\nWendy felt that she was pitiful and pathetic at the same time.\\nAfter some time, Michael stood up and left the office.\\nMichael\\'s lack of an outburst allowed Wendy to heave a sigh of relief.\\n\"Wendy Stewart, don\\'t presume that Michael\\'s departure means that he has agreed to your condition,\" said Yvonne with a smile. \"You can threaten him with his grandmother for now, but I don\\'t believe you can do that for the rest of your life. Just wait and see, I\\'ll make sure Michael kicks you out of this company.\"\\nWendy paid no attention to Yvonne. She returned to her own desk and lowered her head, immersing herself in her work.\\nShe knew she could not beat Yvonne.\\nEven though she was reluctant to admit it, Michael\\'s heart did indeed belong to Yvonne.\\n***\\nIn the following days, Yvonne and Michael still walked around the company around together. However, they never lingered at the assistant\\'s office again.\\nWendy knew that they continued their intimate behavior in places she could not see.\\nSighing softly, she sorted out the documents on her desk and went to deliver them to Michael.\\nAt that moment, Mr. York happened to be reporting to Michael about his work schedule for the rest of the day, \"In half an hour, you have a meeting with Mr. Collins about your collaboration. Your meeting location has been fixed at Hotel J. Miss Zendaya is the secretary assigned to this project. It takes about fifteen minutes to get there, so you should get ready to leave now.\"\\nYvonne had been sitting by the side using her mobile phone. When she spotted Wendy entering the room, her gaze changed. She rose and walked over to Michael, saying, \"Let me go with you. I want to make use of this opportunity to learn how I can help you with your work, Michael.\"\\n\"About that,\" said Mr. York, \"Miss Taylor, you have no experience in these matters. Why don\\'t you wait until you\\'re more familiar with the workflow?\"\\nMr. York was Michael\\'s best assistant. He had been with Michael for five years and he had always been a hard and conscientious worker.\\nAt the same time, he was also someone who could separate work and personal matters very well.\\n\"Won\\'t you and Michael be there as well? I just want to follow you along so I can gain some experience. I promise I won\\'t be a hindrance,\" said Yvonne. The truth was that Yvonne was not a hardworking person, she merely wanted to agitate Wendy.\\n\"Let her come along if she wants to. After all, the discussion is almost finished,\" Michael said before he turned to Yvonne and continued, \"Go look for Miss Zendaya and have her hand over the documents to you.\"\\n\"Thank you, Michael,\" said Yvonne. She set off to look for Miss Zendaya happily, but before she left, she raised her eyebrows at Wendy triumphantly.\\nMr. York stared at Yvonne\\'s retreating back, looking rather displeased.\\nHe tried to persuade Michael, \"Mr. Lucas, you shouldn\\'t allow Miss Taylor to have her way like that. It doesn\\'t matter what you do in your private time, but it\\'s better to set boundaries in work-related affairs.\"\\nMichael raised his head unhappily. He retorted, \"Are you letting how much I pay you get to your head?\"\\nMr. York knew that there was nothing he could say that would be effective. Hence, he made no further comment.\\nAfter they left the office, Wendy packed up his work area.\\nShe had just returned to her own office when the phone on her desk started ringing.\\n\"Good afternoon, this is the assistant\\'s office of MC Enterprise ...\"\\nBefore Wendy could finish speaking, Yvonne\\'s voice was heard over the phone, \"Miss Stewart, we forgot to bring one of the documents. Can I please trouble you to bring it over for us? The folder is on my desk, you will see it when you walk over there.\"\\nWendy could not help but frown when she heard Yvonne\\'s voice. She thought, \\'this woman wants me to deliver a folder?\\'\\nSomething about this felt fishy.\\n\"Why are you asking her to do that, you can just get someone else,\" Michael\\'s voice could be heard over the phone as well.\\n\"She works in the same office as m and since the folder contains the business plan for this project, I don\\'t feel at ease having someone else deliver it.\"\\nBusiness plan?\\nWendy thought, \\'how can Yvonne claim to want to do a good job and then forget to bring such an important document?\\'\\nWendy replied coldly, \"I\\'ll send it over right away.\"\\nAfter hanging up, Wendy walked over to Yvonne\\'s table and saw the folder just as instructed.\\nShe picked it up and made her way to Hotel J.\\nYvonne was waiting for her outside the private room. Wendy handed the folder to Yvonne and immediately turned around to leave.\\nShe had only managed to take two steps when Yvonne\\'s furious voice could be heard from behind her, \"Miss Stewart, even if you have something against me, you should remain impartial at work. Today\\'s discussion with Mr. Collins is such an important one, how could you ... how could you do this ...\"\\nWendy\\'s footsteps came to a halt.\\nWhen Michael heard those words, he immediately emerged from the private room.\\n\"Michael, look, this is the folder that Wendy delivered to me,\" said Yvonne as she handed it over to Michael. \"It\\'s filled with blank paper.\"\\nWhen Wendy heard those words, she shifted her gaze to the folder in Michael\\'s hands.\\nIndeed, it was filled with blank paper.\\n\"What is going on?\" Naturally, Wendy was the first person Michael interrogated.\\n\"She told me that the folder was on her desk, and this is what I took from her desk,\" replied Wendy honestly.\\nShe had already realized that Yvonne was trying to frame her.\\n------------------------------------------------------\\nInstall our App and search \\uf8ffüî•<Unwanted Marriage: Honey, No More Divorce>\\uf8ffüî• to read more exciting chapters'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Educators are making big changes in 2023!\\n\\nHave you added your name for a 25% payrise for educators?'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Endorse a payrise for educators today: https://bigsteps.org.au/endorse'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Join the fight for a 25% wage increase for educators here: https://bigsteps.org.au/endorse'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Calling all educators!\\n\\nWill you join the fight for a 25% wage increase in your sector? \\n\\nhttps://bigsteps.org.au/setting-the-standard'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'New workplace laws come into effect this year, and that means big changes in the way educators can negotiate for better pay and conditions.\\n \\nThis is our chance to finally achieve the wages that educators deserve! \\n\\nYesterday Big Steps educator leaders met nationally and voted for three key issues to campaign for in 2023:\\n\\n1.

These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people‚Äôs party and run for the governorship of Florida.\\n\\nThe idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‚Äòa notorious playboy‚Äô.\\n\\nSecond, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn‚Äôt count as an experience.\\n\\nAt the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don‚Äôt know who was more shocked, myself or the public.\\n\\nBut somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.\\n\\nWhen I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male‚Äôs interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6‚Äôam? Close to Nil.\\n\\nIt was a project doomed for failure from its very start.

I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything‚Ä¶maybe ‚Ä¶. Murder?\\n\\n‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.\\n\\nI slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me‚Äîa good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.\\n\\nA cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.\\n\\nThe slap never came.\\n\\nCracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, ‚ÄúYou thought I was going to hit you?‚Äù his voice was quiet. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù\\n\\nI held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.\\n\\nI stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn‚Äôt tell him or anyone at all.\\n\\nI was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.\\n\\nI shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.\\n\\n‚ÄúI would never hit a woman,‚Äù he mused softly, ‚ÄúI only broke the stupid storage card.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?‚Äù I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.\\n\\nAngry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.\\n\\nThat card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.\\n\\nAn image of a woman‚Äôs pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt was my only hope in paying for my mother‚Äôs hospital bills.\\n\\nOne would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.\\n\\nLife had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.\\n\\nNeither of us expected the stage four breast cancer that took over my mother‚Äôs previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.\\n\\nShe got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.\\n\\nI rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.\\n\\nJust as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.\\n\\nMy knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.\\n\\nI felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.\\n\\nHis arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn‚Äôt be this trembling mess in his arms.\\n\\n‚ÄúHey, Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù\\n\\nI could hear the blood passing through my ears‚Äîthump, thump, thump‚Äîand saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.\\n\\nI fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you claustrophobic?‚Äù now that he wasn‚Äôt holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.\\n\\nI nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn‚Äôt see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since‚Ä¶ I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.\\n\\nI fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.\\n\\nSuddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, ‚ÄúYou are having a panic attack Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and I croaked, ‚ÄúKim... Call me Kim.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI need you to focus on the sound of my voice,‚Äù His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.\\n\\n‚ÄúBreath Kim,‚Äù he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.\\n\\nI tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou are dying.‚Äù A voice in my head said, ‚ÄúThis was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.‚Äù\\n\\nAs if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, ‚ÄúYou are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim‚Ä¶Breath.‚Äù\\n\\nHis voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.\\n\\nMy palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.\\n\\nI felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, ‚ÄúWe are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.‚Äù\\n\\nMy breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.\\n\\nSoon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of the one-sided conversation.\\n\\nHe shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, ‚Äúis it better now?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.\\n\\nNow that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn‚Äôt matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.\\n\\nSuddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\nMy eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nJoey‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\nWhy the* did they come here?\\n\\nI jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.\\n\\nAs if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.\\n\\nThe doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.\\n\\n*ing reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.\\n\\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn‚Äôt felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.\\n\\nA ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.\\n\\nI‚Äôm surprised the spit-fire hasn‚Äôt threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I‚Äôve been staring at her.\\n\\nThe elevator doors pinged.\\n\\nThe top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.\\n\\nWaving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim‚Äôs hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.‚Äù\\n\\nShe shook her head, ‚ÄúGive me one reason I shouldn‚Äôt head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!‚Äù\\n\\nTaken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYou destroyed my* storage card.‚Äù Her eyes shone, ‚ÄúIt had everything in it. Everything!‚Äù\\n\\nShe enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe are kind of in the middle of something,‚Äù I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.\\n\\nThankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.\\n\\nLaurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt brief me that a conference might be held.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.‚Äù\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nSomehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.\\n\\nTheir voices yelled over each other.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, ‚ÄúAs you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.‚Äù His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.\\n\\nI felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.\\n\\nClearly, this wasn‚Äôt her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since‚Ä¶I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet me take it from here,‚Äù I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.\\n\\nAll eyes riveted on me, ‚ÄúAs Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,‚Äù there was a low chorus of laughter, ‚Äúand there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Came from the throng.\\n\\nTightening my hold on Kim‚Äôs trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.\\n\\nRipping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.‚Äù Her voice was breathless.\\n\\nA smile tipped the side of my face, ‚ÄúIt gets better with time.‚Äù\\n\\nShe snapped her head up and glared at me, ‚ÄúHow does THAT get any better?‚Äù her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.\\n\\nI walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.\\n\\nI handed her one and took a sip from mine, ‚ÄúBecause you get used to it.‚Äù\\n\\nShe gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.\\n\\nA hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank*g God.\\n\\nI just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.\\n\\nMy jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I * missed the meeting.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.\\n\\nShe jolted as she saw me standing by the door, ‚ÄúSir? I thought you left.‚Äù\\n\\nI shook my head, ‚ÄúThe elevator broke down.‚Äù\\n\\nIt wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.\\n\\nShe nodded slowly in understanding.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I‚Äôd lose that one.‚Äù She glanced at a note in her hand.\\n\\nI scowled, staring down at my ex-wife‚Äôs name scribbled on the paper, ‚ÄúAnything important?\\n\\n‚ÄúThe usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.‚Äù\\n\\nI crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.\\n\\nThen changing the topic, she pointed at the door, ‚ÄúThey finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured distractedly.\\n\\nI reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, ‚ÄúKimberly Scott?‚Äù\\n\\nI had momentarily forgotten that I wasn‚Äôt alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura‚Äôs wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim replied hesitantly, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, ‚ÄúI am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.‚Äù\\n\\nLegend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?\\n\\nA loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou must give me an autograph,‚Äù Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, ‚ÄúThis is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.‚Äù\\n\\nThe latter it is then.\\n\\nKim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.\\n\\nA few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‚ÄòI hadn‚Äôt been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.\\n\\nShe took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?‚Äù\\n\\nShe nodded, somewhat embarrassed, ‚ÄúOf course, you can.‚Äù\\n\\nLaura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, ‚ÄúUh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.‚Äù\\n\\nShe was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.\\n\\nHelping her out of her misery, I cut in, ‚ÄúYou never told me you were such a big shot,‚Äù I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.\\n\\nBut her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, ‚ÄúYeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‚Äòbig shot.‚Äô Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.‚Äù\\n\\nI didn‚Äôt hear a word she said.\\n\\nHer eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, ‚ÄúDo you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?‚Äù I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.\\n\\nOur eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.\\n\\nLaura immediately chipped in, ‚ÄúKim, you haven‚Äôt published a photo since the last one. Why‚Ä¶?‚Äù she trailed off.\\n\\nKim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, ‚ÄúI have other things taking my time now.‚Äù Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.\\n\\nAt her exit, Laura sighed, ‚Äúyou must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‚Äòan angel.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúAnd what did the media term me as, ‚ÄúDevil?‚Äù I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúThey would be right if they did.‚Äù\\n\\nI snorted.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Narrowing my eyes, I asked, ‚ÄúI know that look, Laura.‚Äù'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Joey Dakota‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\n‚ÄúSir, the polls from the primaries are looking just fine. If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,‚Äù the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, ‚ÄúThen LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúLPP!‚Äù Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, ‚ÄúLiberalism to all!‚Äù\\n\\nHe was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,‚Äù I slapped the secretary on his back, ‚ÄúCongratulations to us all.‚Äù\\n\\nStanding at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people‚Äôs party and run for the governorship of Florida.\\n\\nThe idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‚Äòa notorious playboy‚Äô.\\n\\nSecond, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn‚Äôt count as an experience.\\n\\nAt the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don‚Äôt know who was more shocked, myself or the public.\\n\\nBut somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.\\n\\nWhen I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male‚Äôs interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6‚Äôam? Close to Nil.\\n\\nIt was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.\\n\\n‚ÄúThis is working out.‚Äù My vice governor cheered.\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.\\n\\n11:30 am.\\n\\n‚Äò‚Äô I cursed under my breath, ‚ÄúThis meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.‚Äù I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù\\n\\nHe addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.\\n\\nThe room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.\\n\\nThe noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.\\n\\n‚ÄúIs there a problem Laura?‚Äù I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.\\n\\nHer dark brows knitting, she turned to me, ‚ÄúSir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.‚Äù\\n\\nI arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, ‚ÄúCan it wait till I‚Äôm done at Kota?‚Äù\\n\\nShe shook her head, ‚ÄúNo sir. It can‚Äôt. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúFine, out with it.‚Äù Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.\\n\\nShe glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n\\nThe rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.\\n\\nWife.\\n\\nThe word left a bitter taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.\\n\\nA wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we discuss this at the next meeting?‚Äù\\n\\nLaura‚Äôs eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, ‚ÄúThe primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúBut I thought Mr. Dakota was married?‚Äù an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.\\n\\n‚ÄúIf you all don‚Äôt know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don‚Äôt know what the hell you are doing in here campaigning for him!‚Äù she snapped.\\n\\n‚ÄúAs Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.‚Äù I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.\\n\\nMy jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.\\n\\n‚ÄúPlease wait, hold the elevator.‚Äù\\n\\nI lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.\\n\\nMy annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThe single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.\\n\\nAll thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.\\n\\nHer golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she‚Äôd look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.\\n\\nSuddenly she reached for her camera.\\n\\nA Reporter.\\n\\nI inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I‚Äôd figured, they were nothing but trouble.\\n\\nStriding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nKimberly Scott‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\nSavage and fierce.\\n\\nDevastatingly sexy.\\n\\nHis heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!\\n\\nI snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.\\n\\nJoey Dakota.\\n\\nCEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People‚Äôs Party.\\n\\nA hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.\\n\\nHow atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.\\n\\nJoey Dakota is no different.\\n\\nAfter his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics‚Äîaka stealing from the public.\\n\\nIt was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‚ÄòSerial heartbreaker.‚Äô\\n\\nHe had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.\\n\\nImpulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‚Äòclicking‚Äô sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.\\n\\n‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I rush at him, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing? You can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù\\n\\nBut he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.\\n\\nThat could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.\\n\\nI bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, ‚ÄúHOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.‚Äù\\n\\nIt was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.\\n\\nHe removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent? F* reporters.‚Äù he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.\\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a reporter. And weren‚Äôt you taught how to be courteous to strangers?‚Äù I retorted, ‚ÄúI guess not. Your mother wasn‚Äôt there to teach you manners.‚Äù\\n\\nI watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ‚Äô I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.\\n\\nI quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‚ÄòDing‚Äô and I felt my heart plop into my belly.\\n\\nHe turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù\\n\\nHis voice could cut glass.\\n\\nCelebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything‚Ä¶maybe ‚Ä¶. Murder?\\n\\n‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.\\n\\nI slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me‚Äîa good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.\\n\\nA cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.\\n\\nThe slap never came.\\n\\nCracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, ‚ÄúYou thought I was going to hit you?‚Äù his voice was quiet. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù\\n\\nI held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.\\n\\nI stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn‚Äôt tell him or anyone at all.\\n\\nI was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.\\n\\nI shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.\\n\\n‚ÄúI would never hit a woman,‚Äù he mused softly, ‚ÄúI only broke the stupid storage card.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?‚Äù I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.\\n\\nAngry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.\\n\\nThat card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.\\n\\nAn image of a woman‚Äôs pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt was my only hope in paying for my mother‚Äôs hospital bills.\\n\\nOne would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.\\n\\nLife had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.\\n\\nNeither of us expected the stage four breast cancer that took over my mother‚Äôs previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.\\n\\nShe got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.\\n\\nI rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.\\n\\nJust as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.\\n\\nMy knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.\\n\\nI felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.\\n\\nHis arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn‚Äôt be this trembling mess in his arms.\\n\\n‚ÄúHey, Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù\\n\\nI could hear the blood passing through my ears‚Äîthump, thump, thump‚Äîand saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.\\n\\nI fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you claustrophobic?‚Äù now that he wasn‚Äôt holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.\\n\\nI nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn‚Äôt see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since‚Ä¶ I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.\\n\\nI fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.\\n\\nSuddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, ‚ÄúYou are having a panic attack Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and I croaked, ‚ÄúKim... Call me Kim.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI need you to focus on the sound of my voice,‚Äù His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.\\n\\n‚ÄúBreath Kim,‚Äù he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.\\n\\nI tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou are dying.‚Äù A voice in my head said, ‚ÄúThis was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.‚Äù\\n\\nAs if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, ‚ÄúYou are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim‚Ä¶Breath.‚Äù\\n\\nHis voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.\\n\\nMy palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.\\n\\nI felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, ‚ÄúWe are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.‚Äù\\n\\nMy breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.\\n\\nSoon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of the one-sided conversation.\\n\\nHe shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, ‚Äúis it better now?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.\\n\\nNow that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn‚Äôt matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.\\n\\nSuddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\nMy eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nJoey‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\nWhy the* did they come here?\\n\\nI jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.\\n\\nAs if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.\\n\\nThe doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.\\n\\n*ing reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.\\n\\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn‚Äôt felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.\\n\\nA ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.\\n\\nI‚Äôm surprised the spit-fire hasn‚Äôt threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I‚Äôve been staring at her.\\n\\nThe elevator doors pinged.\\n\\nThe top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.\\n\\nWaving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim‚Äôs hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.‚Äù\\n\\nShe shook her head, ‚ÄúGive me one reason I shouldn‚Äôt head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!‚Äù\\n\\nTaken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYou destroyed my* storage card.‚Äù Her eyes shone, ‚ÄúIt had everything in it. Everything!‚Äù\\n\\nShe enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe are kind of in the middle of something,‚Äù I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.\\n\\nThankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.\\n\\nLaurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt brief me that a conference might be held.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.‚Äù\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nSomehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.\\n\\nTheir voices yelled over each other.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, ‚ÄúAs you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.‚Äù His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.\\n\\nI felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.\\n\\nClearly, this wasn‚Äôt her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since‚Ä¶I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet me take it from here,‚Äù I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.\\n\\nAll eyes riveted on me, ‚ÄúAs Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,‚Äù there was a low chorus of laughter, ‚Äúand there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Came from the throng.\\n\\nTightening my hold on Kim‚Äôs trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.\\n\\nRipping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.‚Äù Her voice was breathless.\\n\\nA smile tipped the side of my face, ‚ÄúIt gets better with time.‚Äù\\n\\nShe snapped her head up and glared at me, ‚ÄúHow does THAT get any better?‚Äù her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.\\n\\nI walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.\\n\\nI handed her one and took a sip from mine, ‚ÄúBecause you get used to it.‚Äù\\n\\nShe gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.\\n\\nA hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank*g God.\\n\\nI just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.\\n\\nMy jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I * missed the meeting.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.\\n\\nShe jolted as she saw me standing by the door, ‚ÄúSir? I thought you left.‚Äù\\n\\nI shook my head, ‚ÄúThe elevator broke down.‚Äù\\n\\nIt wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.\\n\\nShe nodded slowly in understanding.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I‚Äôd lose that one.‚Äù She glanced at a note in her hand.\\n\\nI scowled, staring down at my ex-wife‚Äôs name scribbled on the paper, ‚ÄúAnything important?\\n\\n‚ÄúThe usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.‚Äù\\n\\nI crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.\\n\\nThen changing the topic, she pointed at the door, ‚ÄúThey finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured distractedly.\\n\\nI reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, ‚ÄúKimberly Scott?‚Äù\\n\\nI had momentarily forgotten that I wasn‚Äôt alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura‚Äôs wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim replied hesitantly, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, ‚ÄúI am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.‚Äù\\n\\nLegend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?\\n\\nA loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou must give me an autograph,‚Äù Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, ‚ÄúThis is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.‚Äù\\n\\nThe latter it is then.\\n\\nKim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.\\n\\nA few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‚ÄòI hadn‚Äôt been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.\\n\\nShe took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?‚Äù\\n\\nShe nodded, somewhat embarrassed, ‚ÄúOf course, you can.‚Äù\\n\\nLaura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, ‚ÄúUh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.‚Äù\\n\\nShe was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.\\n\\nHelping her out of her misery, I cut in, ‚ÄúYou never told me you were such a big shot,‚Äù I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.\\n\\nBut her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, ‚ÄúYeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‚Äòbig shot.‚Äô Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.‚Äù\\n\\nI didn‚Äôt hear a word she said.\\n\\nHer eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, ‚ÄúDo you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?‚Äù I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.\\n\\nOur eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.\\n\\nLaura immediately chipped in, ‚ÄúKim, you haven‚Äôt published a photo since the last one. Why‚Ä¶?‚Äù she trailed off.\\n\\nKim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, ‚ÄúI have other things taking my time now.‚Äù Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.\\n\\nAt her exit, Laura sighed, ‚Äúyou must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‚Äòan angel.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúAnd what did the media term me as, ‚ÄúDevil?‚Äù I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúThey would be right if they did.‚Äù\\n\\nI snorted.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Narrowing my eyes, I asked, ‚ÄúI know that look, Laura.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI think I might know what we have to do to get you a bride before the primaries.‚Äù'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'I met with farmers and Traditional Owners in Gunnedah today to let them know The Greens stand with them in their fight to stop Santos wrecking their land, water and Country.\\n\\nThe only place for coal and gas is in the ground ‚úä\\uf8ffüåè'}, {'Label': 1, 'text': 'Are you interested in the First Nations Voice to Parliament or would you like more information?\\n\\nJoin the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Attorney General, Kyam Maher to learn about our State based Voice and ask questions about the upcoming Federal Referendum.\\n\\nWHEN: 6pm ‚Äì 7:30pm | Tuesday 20 June\\nWHERE: Karinya Reserve Clubrooms (Shepherds Hill Road, Eden Hills)\\n\\nRSVPs essential by Friday 16 June.

In the most important decision of his prime ministership and of his career, Anthony Albanese has finalised his proposed constitutional referendum for an Indigenous voice declaring his mission is to change this country.\\n\\nIt is a tragedy because the Australian Constitution needs to recognise the Indigenous people and what they rightly call the ‚Äútorment of our powerlessness‚Äù, yet the Albanese cabinet decision is an extraordinary and flawed model devoid of bipartisanship or any effort to achieve it.\\n\\nThis referendum is a profound risk for Australia. It has been a long process but with extremely limited consultation with the public ‚Äì no constitutional convention, no parliamentary committee collaborating on the model, no meaningful effort to strike bipartisanship, incredibly not even the release of legal advice from the Solicitor-General and then, on Thursday, the Prime Minister doubling down in a rejection of efforts to modify or temper the model whose flaws have been documented.\\n\\nIn his announcement Albanese endorsed a maximalist voice, thereby guaranteeing a fundamental change in Australia‚Äôs system of parliamentary and executive governance and making a contentious referendum even more contentious. Instead of putting qualifications on the voice Albanese went the other way ‚Äì bowing before the Indigenous working group, he refused any meaningful change to the voice‚Äôs capacity to advise the executive government or address reported concerns of the Solicitor-General and Attorney-General.\\n\\nThis is no way to finalise a referendum question. The optics are disastrous ‚Äì Albanese left the impression of a compliant prime minister submitting to Indigenous demands. There is no reason to change the recent assessment offered to the Sydney Institute by human rights lawyer and voice supporter Frank Brennan: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs proposed is too fixed, too simple, it won‚Äôt fly and I don‚Äôt think the Australian public would ever accept it.‚Äù\\n\\nFor Albanese, it is a personal mission. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to change the country,‚Äù he said. He wants to change the Constitution ‚Äúto recognise the fullness of our history‚Äù. Magnificent vision. But beware prime ministers when they get emotional; it usually means a lurch into unreality.\\n\\nDo cabinet ministers understand what they signed off on Thursday morning? This is constitutionally empowered group rights tied to constitutionally empowered unlimited representations. It is unprecedented in a dual sense. If carried, it will change our governance and society. There is no way the Coalition could support this model and retain its integrity. It is a sad conclusion from Albanese‚Äôs latest remarks that he seeks to carry this referendum on a tactic of deception ‚Äì relying on goodwill, emotions and the injustice Indigenous people have faced for so long.\\n\\nThis is an intellectual and moral deception. And that needs to be said now because if this referendum is defeated its origins will lie with the decisions Albanese announced on Thursday and the defeat will be his responsibility as the prime decision-maker.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt blame the Indigenous leaders. Having lacked political power for so long, when they saw a compliant prime minister they went for broke. The trouble is that Albanese has saddled himself with a model riddled with problems that guarantees a tactic of constant undermining by the No side.\\n\\nThe tragedy is that Albanese has conflated the just cause of Indigenous recognition with a model of the voice that breaches too many principles and runs too many risks to be supported.\\n\\nThe essence of this referendum is the insertion into the Constitution of a new institution with a vast constitutional ambit. It is a political institution designed to achieve a political purpose. There are numerous problems with the model but Labor essentially has chosen to ignore them and press ahead in a ‚Äúcrash through or crash‚Äù fatalism.\\n\\nIt is, frankly, incredible that since Albanese outlined his proposed referendum at the Garma Festival seven months ago there has been no public institutional process to examine and assess the proposal ‚Äì just talk behind closed doors. This is an unacceptable foundation on which to ask the Australian people to endorse probably the most far-reaching referendum proposal since Federation.\\n\\nThis is an exceptionally rare referendum since it seeks to create a new chapter in the Australian Constitution. Albanese keeps up the pretence this is a ‚Äúmodest‚Äù proposal. That is false. There will be a new chapter nine in our Constitution that enshrines the voice. It will stand with earlier chapters dealing with the institutions of constitutional nationhood ‚Äì parliament (chapter one), executive (chapter two), judiciary (chapter three) and so on.\\n\\nIt becomes a new advisory arm of government or what barrister Louise Clegg ventures to call ‚Äúa fourth arm of government‚Äù.\\n\\nThe voice is an institution based on group or racial identity but empowered to make representations across the ambit of general laws and policymaking affecting the whole community since Indigenous people are part of the community. This is unprecedented in intent and scope.\\n\\nWe are told by Albanese this will unite the country. How does that work? If the Australian public understood what this institutional arrangement involved would they vote for it? That‚Äôs why Albanese‚Äôs campaign says the two issues are recognition and consultation. But that‚Äôs misleading. \\n\\nThere are thousands, probably millions, of people who support recognition and consultation but who will oppose the voice because they believe it is divisive or dangerous. Law professor Megan Davis, a member of the working group, told ABC radio the Prime Minister had listened to the working group. She said the voice ‚Äúwill have an extraordinary impact in terms of the government of the day and the parliament‚Äù. It would be proactive; it wouldn‚Äôt wait to be consulted. It is ‚Äúa very, very powerful mechanism‚Äù. We should believe her.\\n\\nThe referendum is about power. The voice will make representations not just to parliament but the executive government including cabinet, ministers and public servants as decision-makers. The idea the voice has limited influence because it is advisory is disingenuous. It will function as a powerful political entity exerting enormous influence. That‚Äôs the entire purpose. It‚Äôs what the whole idea is about.\\n\\nThe constitutional amendment is open-ended and unlimited, such that the voice can make representations on virtually anything ‚Äì from the conditions of Indigenous people to tax, social, economic, resources, cultural, defence and foreign policy.\\n\\nTrying to impose order on this open-ended constitutional power, Brennan urged the government to a surgical change ‚Äì limiting or excluding its executive government advice in the Constitution, eliminating public servants from any constitutional ambit and letting the parliament take any such decisions.\\n\\nHe got nowhere. His effort trying to get a more viable, acceptable model was seen as counter-productive. Labor wants a voice with maximum interventionist scope, thereby inviting maximum resistance from the Coalition side of politics. This is smart politics? There is a fatalism at work here. Brennan argued that because the voice cannot possibly know about the multitude of decisions envisaged by hundreds of public servants affecting Indigenous people this would open the door to litigation, with the voice claiming it had been overlooked or muted. \\n\\nWhat is the government‚Äôs response? Incredibly, it is enunciation of a new principle, outlined by Albanese, that the parliament and executive government should seek ‚Äúwritten advice from the voice early in the development of proposed laws and policies‚Äù.\\n\\nThe voice doesn‚Äôt just make representations. It needs to be told beforehand ‚Äì confirmation that the voice will be integrated into the system of government and parliament, adding another layer of review, advice and complexity. How far does this extend? Will public servants be required to give notice to the voice every time they are going to make a decision that might affect an Aboriginal person? Will all this await clarification from the High Court?\\n\\nAlbanese is committed to ensuring the voice can make representations to the executive government but has failed to deliver a constitutional amendment that makes this workable. Brennan warns that the impact on the public service will be ‚Äúsomewhat equivalent to ‚Äì though bigger than ‚Äì the major commonwealth administrative law reforms that occurred in Australia in the 1970s‚Äù.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said people should support the referendum because we will ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù about ourselves. This is insulting and demeaning. It debases what this referendum is about and really says people don‚Äôt need to worry about what Albanese is proposing to do with our Constitution. The more he says this, the more he insults people. On every issue Albanese has deferred to the authority of the voice. This is surely an omen of the future ‚Äì he has previously said it would be a brave government that ignored the advice of the voice. This underlines the sheer enormity of the political nature of this proposal.\\n\\nHow will the public respond? Clegg asked this question in her presentation to the recent Uphold and Recognise conference when she supported a far more modest model for the voice. Will ordinary Australians be impressed when voice members give doorstop TV interviews on parliamentary sitting days? Will they be impressed when there are public brawls over whether the voice has been properly consulted and listened to? Will they be impressed when there are deals done and horse-trading between voice members and federal parliamentarians?\\n\\nHow will advice from the voice stand with advice from the 11 Indigenous democratically elected members of the federal parliament? Who will have greater legitimacy and claim to be listened to?\\n\\nHow will the public service respond? Who in the executive government will get representations from the voice? The minister or the departmental head, or maybe a special unit created in every department and authority? What rules and processes will the public service follow after a representation from the voice arrives? Compliance in fear of retribution, or rejection with all the risks that involves?\\n\\nAlbanese would have made his political calculations. He believes, obviously, the voice will be carried. He must also believe the referendum will damage Peter Dutton‚Äôs standing and leadership though such damage probably depends on the voice being carried when Dutton opposes it. Finally, Albanese must think Australia has reached a turning point ‚Äì that generational change means its historic aversion to supporting referendums is broken and the voice will constitute a new pathway in our political and constitutional life.\\n\\nThese are big calculations with big risks. This looms as a remarkable moment for Australia given our elites ‚Äì the professional classes, corporate leaders and progressive opinion-makers ‚Äì seem united in supporting the referendum, with Labor assuming they will put money behind it. That means corporate leaders need to be held to account and explain why they support such a radical change to our governance, constitutional principles and society in a referendum where the government refuses to even release the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice surrounding its proposal.\\n\\nThis referendum will become the most critical test for many years of the character and leadership quality of those elites.\\n\\nThe federal Opposition Leader and his legal affairs spokesman, Julian Leeser, have called for the release of the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice. This is essential in terms of transparency. It may support the model or it may not ‚Äì but we need to see it. Labor had no problem releasing the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice to attack Scott Morrison over the multiple ministries ‚Äì but no appearance of the Solicitor-General‚Äôs advice on putting a new chapter into the Australian Constitution. Not important enough? What does that tell you about the Albanese government?\\n\\nThe government says the best legal minds in the country have been involved in devising the words. That‚Äôs good. The reality, however, is that the best legal minds in the country cannot stop issues arising from the voice being referred to the High Court.\\n\\nIt is true the voice cannot dictate outcomes of the parliament and executive from its representations.\\n\\nBut granting the voice the power to make representations to public servants means the voice needs to know that a public servant has considered the representation in making a decision. Failing that, the voice can seek judicial review of a flawed decision.\\n\\nAlbanese says he feels the weight of history and responsibility. He says Indigenous people have waited long enough and cannot wait any longer, that it is time to recognise 65,000 years of history and that this decision is ‚Äúa matter from the heart‚Äù. All this is true.\\n\\nThe work done by Indigenous leaders over years on this project has been immense. There are many reasons to support the referendum ranging from historic injustice to establishing a mechanism to allow Indigenous people to be consulted and to make representations on issues that concern them. There is no problem with these sentiments or these principles.\\n\\nThe problem is the model of the voice being proposed, its extraordinary constitutional powers and their implications. It is fatuous to say those constitutional powers, once granted, will not be used. The case against the referendum lies in its essence ‚Äì the institutional power it seeks to create. That is where the decision must be weighed and made. Albanese carries the final responsibility for that model ‚Äìand he has failed that test.\"\\n\\nPaul Kelly\\nEditor-At-Large'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'It‚Äôs NSW election time ‚Äì MAKE YOUR VOICE (AND VOTE) HEARD NOW!!\\n\\nMost candidates for election in Goulburn and Monaro electorates have said they are personally opposed to Veolia‚Äôs current Tarago incinerator proposal.\\n\\nBut personal opposition doesn‚Äôt do anything to stop Veolia moving ahead with the incinerator in the State Significant Planning Process which is stacked against local communities.\\n\\nWhat we need is a commitment that their party will ban incineration in Tarago and the Southern Tablelands, something that could quickly and easily be achieved via regulation amendment.\\n\\nOnly the Shooters Fishers and Farmers Party, The Greens NSW and Legalise Cannabis NSW Party (LCNSW) have a policy to do so and we applaud them for that. \\n\\nThe NSW Liberal Party, NSW Nationals and NSW Labor parties refuse.

Not only did communities get non-performing mergers that they didn‚Äôt want, they are now paying 30%-60% more in Council rates for it!\\n\\nLoss of community voice, loss of representation, overwhelming bureaucracy and the enormous party-political control seen in many merged Councils has had major impact on communities and on Council performance.  \\n\\nAs we know in the Inner West, there is a major reason that the Labor Party is fighting against the demerger ‚Ä¶ it has delivered them full control over OUR Council.  The merger has been about what is best for the Labor Party NOT what is best for the Inner West community.  \\n\\nAt the poll, more people voted to demerge Inner West Council (104,219) than voted for their Councillors (104,035).

ATSI peoples make up 3.8% of the Australian population.  \\n\\nIf we look at the LOWER HOUSES of Parliament, ATSI representation is LOW at the Federal level.

I can‚Äôt do it by doing something constructive and positive because that takes time and actual work. I will get heaps of social media coverage if I just throw some disgusting comments out there to get a good reaction. Just like protesting at a soldier‚Äôs funeral to further traumatise family and outrage others or setting up some ‚Äúgod hates‚Äù banners somewhere near a school, where can those that need attention get it? How do I inflict maximum damage, get maximum shock and awe and gaslight Millions in one swoop? Maybe I should put up some signs out the front of the local adolescent psychiatric service to tell them their mental health needs are a drain on society. Just like a primary school bully looking to feel big and strong because they are suffering themselves, who‚Äôs an easy target for a scared little child that needs to feel good about themselves? Let‚Äôs pick the disabled kid, that‚Äôll be easy!\\n\\nMr Night explained, ‚Äúwe saw the NDIS legislation attacked in previous years so that essential service levels and equipment could be stripped, and delegates could bypass any accountability via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt appears our leaders prior to the change of Government thought too many people are challenging our poor decisions, so let's cut out their ability to question. It can't possibly be because we have got things wrong when we suggested the person with the permanent spinal injury should be cured by now and not need the funded support we decided to strip them of without warning or any sort of rationale.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat did some politicians use then to try and get those disgusting changes passed we see again this week? They suggest everyone on NDIS is using the funds for strippers and holidays to the Gold Coast. They seem to think, that will help them distract from their actual goals because most Australians won‚Äôt realise how absurd that is. Even when the NDIS was still under budget and rolling out, they cried wolf saying it was costing too much, hoping no one fact checked them. \\n\\n‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt even a code to claim funds for sex workers in NDIS pricing. We are having trouble getting a new wheelchair approved for kids that is the right size most days, but yeah lets attack NDIS by suggesting the funds are being used for 500 000 participants to get special cuddles from a stranger.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhen faced with the choice of having staff hours to shower you, dress you, and support you with essential daily living tasks, we can assure the Australian public that the weekly trip to the local brothel isn‚Äôt even on the horizon for the 4.4 million Australia‚Äôs living with disability. It is something many of those stuck on the Disability Support Pension, due to the employment bias, will need to save up for if they do want it.\\n\\n‚ÄúSex is of course a perfectly legal and normal part of an adult‚Äôs life but those living in the distance past still probably can‚Äôt cope with that idea, let alone sex when you have a disability! Of course, lets continue the narrative that sexuality and identity is off limits to people living with disability, aged care and of course how gross is it that our parents still kiss each other! Ewwww don‚Äôt talk about sex or recognise sexuality in any way no matter how aged appropriate and present in the lives of every Australian. Knowing how uncomfortable people are talking about sex, that‚Äôs a great way to distract and gas light our most vulnerable populations and sadly we see a few people use it as their fall-back script.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe the 4.4 million Australia‚Äôs living with disability are voters. We also have family that see what we live with and it is a poor move to attack that level of voting public. We are not your playthings and we are not tolerating abuse and neglect. We are not tolerating our elected officials gas lighting and bringing disrepute to the office they hold and privileged position they are paid by us as taxpayers to experience. The essential services 500 000+ Australia‚Äôs receive are not yours to leverage and threaten when they are constantly under budget and cost less than your submarines and the latest railway project in the city.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt is time Australia stops hiding behind an idea that calling out bigots and leaders that are behaving badly is somehow off limits. We all deserve better from our leaders and if attacking the disabled kid in school is how you get your kicks, make a name, get your feeling of self-worth and importance, what a poor excuse you are for a human being, let alone a politician or community leader.\\n\\n‚ÄúI feel great sadness for those people that they seek to target the 4.4 million Australians living with disability to spin their political agenda. Bullies need to be seen as what they are; people behaving badly and usually needing support due to the difficulties they have in their own lives. Maybe they were bullied themselves for having the wrong hair colour, skin colour or voice. Break the cycle of abuse and be the change you want to see. \\n\\n‚ÄúThere needs to be healthy boundaries as acts that are plain disgusting, we have seen this last month should not be tolerated from our elected officials. Any other employee would be dismissed on the spot. We are a force to be reckoned with and will not tolerate our elected representatives acting like children.

Her father had built it from a dream he\\'d had, or so he\\'d told us when we were young girls. Looking at it now, I believed it. Little did I know that, in this house, all of my dreams would start to come true.\\n\\nFive years had gone by since the last time I came to Miami. Pulling up to Tally\\'s house felt just like it had been so many times before. I had spent so many summers in this home, coming here was like greeting an old friend. \\n\\nThe mansion had tall, white, towering columns lining the porch, accenting the huge archways over the doors. The architecture was unique to Tally\\'s father\\'s taste, which made sense since he had dreamed it up. \\n\\nThe difference now was the roof had been redone in Mediterranean terracotta shingles, and the landscaping was completely different, now with an Italian flare. Mr. Valentino had even added a white marble fountain to the front yard that featured a goddess being worshiped. He had really outdone himself and based on the looks of the outside, I couldn\\'t wait to see what he had changed inside. This was my home away from home. \\n\\n‚ÄúOh, my god!\"\" Tally screamed excitedly. ‚ÄúLook at this place! Dad really did a number on the renovations, didn\\'t he, Becca?\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah, totally awesome,\"\" I replied, glancing towards Tally, shaking my head.\\n\\nThank god she has never been to my parents\\' house. As much as I didn\\'t want to think Tally would judge the way I grew up‚Äîshe would. Prim and proper was Tally\\'s norm. These sorts of luxuries weren\\'t possible for someone like me.\\n\\nI didn\\'t come from mansions or luxury cars or tight security. My family didn\\'t have yachts and butlers and maids. All of which seemed to tend to any need Tally could possibly ever have. But it didn\\'t matter to me in the end. I loved the life I lived, and I was grateful to have been able to take part in Tally\\'s as well.\\n\\nHow we had become friends I would never understand, but I was grateful to have her. We had been there for each other through a lot, and no matter how much we could irritate each other, we were like sisters.\\n\\n‚ÄúI\\'m starving. I wonder if Dad has a small spread ready for our arrival,\"\" she murmured as she grabbed her stuff and glanced at me. ‚ÄúReady to get this party started?\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúSure.\"\" Shaking my head with a smile, I watched her move with excitement towards the front door. Its mahogany finish gleamed in the Miami sun. Beautiful. That\\'s what it was.\\n\\nPassing the threshold, it was as if being instantly transported to Italy. The decor embellished every inch of the Tuscan Valley, highlighting every aspect of the magical home. The last time I had come here was when Tally\\'s parents got divorced. At that point in time, the home was still wildly styled to Tally\\'s mother\\'s taste. So seeing her father\\'s preference brought to life was a refreshing sight. \\n‚ÄúDaddy!\"\" Tally screamed, dropping all of her bags to the floor haphazardly as she moved towards the kitchen. ‚ÄúI\\'m home!\"\"\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure why Tally continued to act like she was five, but at the same time, I was too entranced with the decor to care. Carefully, I sat done my things next to Tally\\'s while my eyes stared at the ceiling as I spun slowly in a circle, taking it all in.\\n\\n‚ÄúMaybe he isn\\'t here,\"\" I said as my eyes met hers once more. \\n‚ÄúHe is here. His car was in the drive, and he told me he had a long meeting. That\\'s why he didn\\'t meet us at the airport.\"\"\\n\\nRolling my eyes, my face must express a smirk as I took a seat on one of the tall vintage barstools. There was only so much Tally-drama I could deal with, and considering we hadn\\'t even been here ten minutes, I would say this was a new record. Regardless, though, I didn\\'t want to partake in the conversation she was about to have with him. I already knew where it would go. \\n\\n‚ÄúWell,\"\" I shrugged, ‚Äúmaybe he took another car?\"\" \\n\\nIt\\'s not like he is short on the money to afford it.\\n\\n‚ÄúThis is not right!\"\" Tally screamed out in frustration. ‚ÄúHe was supposed to greet me as soon as I got home.\"\"\\n\\nAh. There she is! Princess Tally at her finest. As my eyes cast towards the window in the kitchen, I caught sight of the Adonis-like figure swimming laps in the pool. There was no doubt in my mind who it was....Because I already knew. James Valentino. Tally\\'s father.\\n\\nSince I was sixteen years old, I had thought about him. I knew it was wrong, but at the same time, it was a childish fantasy. One I never dared to share with Tally. Not to mention her father would never dare take advantage of a young girl. \\n\\n‚ÄúUh, it looks like he is getting out of the pool,\"\" I breathed out, trying to divert my attention.\\nNo matter how many times I tried to take my eyes off of him, I couldn\\'t. He was far too breathtaking. Oh dear God. Is he getting more attractive the older he gets?\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat?\"\" She gasped as she glanced in the direction I was looking. ‚ÄúSwimming instead of meeting me when I walked through the door?\"\"\\n\\nThe disdain in her voice snapped me out of my trance and caused me to roll my eyes.\\n\\n‚ÄúI don\\'t understand what the big deal is, Tally. Who cares? We are here now, and we have an entire summer to enjoy.\"\"\\n\\nShe spun to face me; her gaze spoke volumes about her unhappiness. ‚ÄúI know this.\"\"\\n‚ÄúSooo?\"\" I shrugged. ‚ÄúThen what\\'s the big deal?\"\"\\n\\nCrossing her arms, she scoffed, ‚ÄúBecause Daddy always greets me at the door. You don\\'t think he has a new woman, do you?\"\"\\nLaughter escapes me as I stare at her in disbelief. ‚ÄúSeriously? That\\'s your go-to?\"\"\\n‚ÄúWell‚Äî\"\" she shrugged in frustration, ‚ÄúI read online that when men change their patterns, it\\'s usually because of a big change... like a new woman.\"\"\\n\\nShould have seen that. It\\'s what happened with Chad, I silently noted with a sigh. I couldn\\'t understand her reasoning. ‚ÄúWould that honestly be a bad thing?\"\"\\n‚ÄúYes!\"\" she shrieked. ‚ÄúOh, my god, Becca. That would be like the worst thing ever. If he wants a woman, he can get back with my mom.\"\"\\n\\nJust as she said the words, the sliding glass door opened, and the most attractive man I had ever laid my eyes on stepped through the doorway. The Italian Stallion has arrived. God, he is so charming.\\n\\nThe unbelievable remark running through my mind caused me to hold myself as my eyes could not stop staring at him. No matter how much time passed, I still had the imagination to be around him into the new year.  I would do anything to make him happy. I don‚Äôt mind, I\\'m not picky.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhere were you?\"\" Tally snapped with disapproval, pulling me from my delicious thoughts. ‚ÄúI expected to see you, and you weren\\'t there. I don\\'t understand.\"\"\\n\\nConfusion passed through his eyes as he stared at her with shock. ‚ÄúSweetie, I didn\\'t think your flight was supposed to be here for another hour.\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúUh‚Äìno,\"\" she quipped. ‚ÄúI sent you my flight info, and I texted you.\"\"\\n‚ÄúYou did?\"\" he replied, picking his phone off the bar and quickly scrolling through it.\\nStanding impatiently, she stared at him. ‚ÄúYeah, I did.\"\"\\n‚ÄúI\\'m sorry, sweetie,\"\" he shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess it slipped my mind. I\\'ll make it up to you.\"\"\\nSmart man. Smart man.\\n\\nWhen it came to Tally, we both knew how to act. Because if Tally didn\\'t get her way, you would think World War III was breaking out due to her disregard and meltdowns.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt\\'s okay,\"\" she sighed. ‚ÄúBecca and I are hungry and tired. Can we order food?\"\"\\nAs his eyes slowly slid to me, he furrowed his brow in confusion, ‚ÄúBecca?\"\"\\n\\nOf course, he doesn\\'t recognize me. ‚ÄúHey,\"\" I smiled, trying not to look down.\\n\\nThis man was really difficult to ignore, and with my nonexistent romance for the past few weeks, I was completely distracted. Come on now, Becca. Stop thinking weird about your friend\\'s dad. What on earth are you thinking!\\n\\n‚ÄúYou have grown up a lot, Becca,\"\" Mr. Valentino replied, his dark, sultry gaze scanning up and down me. \\n\\nOh gosh. Was he checking me out?!\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah.\"\" The breathlessness of my response caused me to clear my throat as I quickly averted my gaze, trying to look anywhere but at him. I wasn\\'t trying to be rude, but if this conversation didn\\'t end quickly, I was going to give away my unrealistic thoughts by looking at his charming look.\\n\\n‚ÄúSo...\"\" he muttered, looking between the two of us. ‚ÄúWhat are the plans for summer?\"\"\\nBefore I could even get a word in, Tally started rambling off about the parties and boating trips she wanted to take. Even though I was her guest, he was already accustomed to the fact we often did things apart.\\n\\n‚ÄúAnd you, Becca?\"\" he asked, bringing me back to the present. ‚ÄúAnything you would like to do?\"\"\\nYeah, dreaming about you.\\n\\n‚ÄúUm. I\\'m not quite sure yet. Had some rough stuff happen a few weeks back, so kind of looking to relax and enjoy my summer? Then, it\\'s back to school for my last year.\"\" I smiled, nodding my head as a glint of amusement crossed his eyes.\\n\\n‚ÄúOh, very nice,\"\" he said, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúWhat was your degree again?\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúStatistics and Data Science,\"\" I replied as I gazed down at my fidgeting hands.\\n\\n‚ÄúShe\\'s a math nerd, Dad. You give her anything to do with numbers, and she is quick with a response. Bookkeeping and calculations and all that stuff. Kind of like you.\"\"\\n\\nTally\\'s response caused me to laugh before I cleared my throat, realizing I was finding amusement in her calling her dad a math nerd, basically. \\n\\n‚ÄúSomething like that,\"\" his reply was followed by making a little expression on his face as my gaze met his once more. I didn\\'t understand what was going through his head at that moment, but I was intrigued to find out.\\n\\nPulling out her phone, I watched as Tally replied to whatever text she got while smacking on the bright pink bubble gum she had consumed at some point. ‚ÄúOh dear. Becca, we need to get unpacked. Jesse wants us to meet for food.\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúOh‚Äìokay,\"\" I said, not really looking forward to it. ‚ÄúI thought we were going to eat here.\"\"\\n‚ÄúI can order food,\"\" Mr. Valentino said happily as he glanced between Tally and I. \\n‚ÄúNo, no,\"\" Tally scoffed. ‚ÄúWe are just going to go out.\"\"\\n\\nI felt bad about the situation overall. Mr. Valentino didn\\'t know we were going to be here so soon, and Tally was acting childish. Even if I loved her dearly, the way she was acting was unacceptable.\\n\\n‚ÄúOkay then,\"\" he smiled. ‚ÄúIt\\'s really nice to have you home, sweetie. I hope we can spend some time together while you\\'re here.\"\"\\n\\nThe notion warmed my heart and made me miss my own father. But in true Tally fashion, she didn\\'t hold the same sweet sentiment I did.\\n\\n‚ÄúI\\'ll fit something in,\"\" she replied as she made her way towards the stairs. ‚ÄúCan Rosa bring our things upstairs, please? I need to unpack and take a shower.\"\"\\n\\nAs Tally disappeared from sight, I shook my head, jumping off the barstool.\\n‚ÄúThanks for letting me stay for the summer, Mr. Valentino. I appreciate it.\"\"\\n\\nHis eyes drifted from where his daughter had disappeared to me, and as he looked at me, I couldn\\'t help but feel small under his gaze. ‚ÄúThere is no need to thank me, Becca. Also, will you please call me James?\"\"\\n\\nFirst name basis? Oh, gosh‚Ä¶ Becca, stop, you\\'re reading too much into it.\\n‚ÄúIf that\\'s what you would like‚Ä¶ James,\"\" I replied softly, fluttering my eyelashes. ‚ÄúI better get going. I guess I\\'ll see you around.\"\"\\n\\nRaising a brow, his smile never faltered as he nodded, ‚ÄúOh, you definitely will.\"\"\\nGoing out with Tally had been more of a headache than I wanted it to be. What started out with dinner turned into an all-nighter at a local club. The stench of stale stuff littered my clothing from earlier in the night, as well as, the few droplets of puke Tally had managed to get on me when I was near her.\\nIt shouldn\\'t have been much of a surprise how the evening turned out. Yet, once again, I was left to babysit her while she dabbled in the fun. \\n\\nI wasn\\'t the party girl Tally had become, and even though she knew that, she still tried to drag me around. Sometimes I wondered if that was simply a way to make sure she had a designated driver or if she genuinely enjoyed my company.\\n\\nBy the time we had arrived back at her home, the lights were off, and it was dark. Tally was unable to carry herself up the stairs, which meant that it had been my job to do so.\\nLucky me!\\n\\nAfter I had helped Tally with her dress and put her in bed, and a hot shower had washed away the remainder of the night from myself, I lay on my bed, trying to find the will to go to sleep. Too much had happened over the past few weeks. My mind still reeled from my breakup with Chad, but I also couldn\\'t stop thinking about James.\\n\\nJames was different. Not only was he incredibly attractive, with his perfect look I wanted to be around him for days, but he was old school. He seemed like the kind of man who knew how to wine and dine a girl. Treat her special, and never cheat on her with some mystery girl like Chad did to me. \\n\\nI didn\\'t know James that way, but my mind constantly wondered. I wondered how he would treat me and about all the wonderful things he could do to me. I didn\\'t understand the rush of emotions he brought over me. I wasn\\'t the bad girl type, and yet everything about him wanted to make me just be around him.\\n\\nI\\'m an unreasonable person to think a man like James Valentino would be interested in me though. Allison, Tally\\'s mom, is beautiful and classy. She has taste and is sophisticated‚Ä¶ I can never be her.\\nTally had plenty of male friends in this city, and even though I didn\\'t want another relationship, I couldn\\'t help but wonder if one of them would want to be with me. \\nPicking up my phone, I scrolled through social media and took in the various photos of Chad and I that were posted on my account. I hadn\\'t had the courage to get rid of them yet, and looking back at it now, I felt even more pathetic.\\n\\nWith a push of a few buttons and much-needed courage, I deleted the history of my relationship with Chad. I welcomed the hollow feeling when I was finished, but at the same time, it hurt.\\n‚ÄúGod, why can\\'t I sleep,\"\" I groaned as I looked at the clock, realizing I had spent two hours lying awake instead of sleeping.\\n\\nSlipping from bed, I padded my way out of my room and towards the stairs. The idea of hot tea and a snack to settle my mind seemed more enjoyable with every step I took.\\n\\nThrough the darkness, I made my way to the kitchen. The dim light over the stove was enough for me to see what I was doing, and yet, not disturb anyone in the home. Not that anyone would likely wake. It was 3:00 in the morning, and normal people slept at this hour. \\n\\nAs I moved around the kitchen setting the kettle, I hummed a tune from earlier in the night that had gotten stuck in my head. \\n\\n‚ÄúHaving fun?\"\" a voice called from behind me, causing a small scream to leave my throat as I spun around, coming face to face with James himself. His dark, brooding eyes stared at me with amusement.\\n\\nAs much as I wanted to form a coherent sentence at that moment, my thoughts were lost in the realization that James, my best friend\\'s father, was standing before me. \\nOh, sweet baby Jesus. ‚ÄúUh-oh, hey. Sorry, just making tea.\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúI see that,\"\" he hummed with amusement. ‚ÄúCouldn\\'t sleep either?\"\"\\nShaking my head, I shrugged my shoulders. ‚ÄúNot lately. Plus, after all the excitement tonight, I had to wind down.\"\"\\n\\nThere was a moment of awkward silence that fell between us as James stood by the counter, simply staring at me. Clearing my throat, I turned back towards the kettle that was now hissing and poured the hot water over the tea bag so it could steep. Motion out of the corner of my eye made me freeze as I realized he had taken two steps towards me.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou really have changed over the years‚Ä¶ haven\\'t you, Becca?\"\" he whispered softly, causing me to turn around and notice only a few feet between us.\\n\\nMy heart raced with anticipation of what was happening. Was this what I hoped it was? But I couldn\\'t do that to Tally, could I?\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah,\"\" I replied uncomfortably, ‚ÄúI guess I have. I\\'m not really the dorky girl I was the last time I was here. Then again, I could say you have changed as well.\"\"\\n\\nHe had changed. He had gotten older, obviously, but he didn\\'t seem as sad as he once had. Instead, he seemed satisfied with his life. As if he finally found his calling after leaving his ex-wife, Allison.\\n\\n‚ÄúInteresting.\"\" His eyes took me in once more as he casually leaned against the counter. ‚ÄúSo, did your boyfriend decide to join you this summer as well?\"\"\\n\\nMy eyes kept drifting down on him. His figure was hard to ignore. I tried not to look, but I couldn\\'t help it when he stood so willingly in front of me.\\n\\n‚ÄúUh, no.\"\" I shrugged, trying to remain calm. ‚ÄúI don\\'t have one. We broke up a few weeks ago.\"\"\\nIntrigue seemed to get to him as I responded. As if that had been the answer he was hoping for. \\n\\n‚ÄúIs that right? Was it mutual then?\"\" \\n\\nGlancing down, I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo, not exactly.\"\"\\n\\nNo matter how innocent his question had been, the wound of Chad\\'s betrayal was still fresh. So for James to bring it up was like pouring salt on an open wound.\\n\\n‚ÄúI\\'m sorry if I upset you, Becca. That wasn\\'t my intention.\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúNo, no. You\\'re fine,\"\" I replied as my eyes met his again. ‚ÄúJust, bad things happened, and it wasn\\'t the most joyous moment in my life. Nothing I won\\'t get over with in time, though.\"\"\\n\\nThere was an unmistakable fire that crossed his gaze for a moment at my words. I wasn\\'t sure what it was, but it was almost as if he was angry, but pleased at the same time.\\n\\n‚ÄúHe was not smart enough for letting a beautiful woman like you go.\"\" \\n\\nOh gosh, he just called me beautiful. The compliment caused my cheeks to redden with embarrassment as I tried to hold myself and quickly turned back to my tea.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure why his remark surprised me like it did. Men from his generation were notorious for being this way, or at least, that was the assumption I had with most men I knew his age. My professors and even my dad\\'s friends were from a generation of class. So why was it that his words caused me to react like this? Trying to wrap my head around what he was saying, I cleared my throat and straightened my shoulders. \\n\\n‚ÄúThank you for your compliment. But I am not as pretty as other women. Plus, I am driven when it comes to my career. So I wasn\\'t giving him the attention he wanted.\"\"\\n\\nExcuses. They were all excuses, but at the same time, these excuses were what allowed me to get past the pain I felt over Chad\\'s betrayal. The excuses I made were ones I gave for his actions towards me. No matter how horrible they were.\\n\\n‚ÄúHe didn\\'t deserve you. Traits like that I think are attractive in a woman,\"\" James replied moving next to me, causing my breath to catch in my throat. I was highly aware of the distance between us in the kitchen. The fact that we were being alone made me excited, and I hoped he couldn\\'t tell how much I felt. \\n\\nSlowly turning around, I faced him. In the time I hadn\\'t been paying attention, he had got himself there near me, and the distance between us caused my heart to race.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t trying to be bad, but the smell of him wrapping around me made me want to do all kinds of bad things. ‚ÄúPerhaps, someday, someone will show me what it is I deserve.\"\" \\n\\nMy words came off more suggestive than I\\'d meant them to be, and he must have noticed, because his response was to look at me gently as he moved toward me. Being near him did not help me with my imagination to be just with him. I wanted it so bad to happen, but at the same time, there was no way a man like James Valentino wanted me. Not to mention, you ungrateful girl, that is your best friend\\'s dad.\\n\\nAs he pulled back, setting his cup on the counter, I tried to clear my mind. There was a boundary I didn\\'t need to cross, and with the teasing moments around us, I was dangerously close to crossing.\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you okay?\"\" he whispered, causing me to slowly look up at him to see the amusement dancing within his eyes.\\n\\n‚ÄúOf course, why wouldn\\'t I be?\"\" I shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúAre you?\"\"\\n\\nAs his eyes drifted down, I felt the stir within me once more.\\n\\n‚ÄúOh, I\\'m more than alright, Becca.\"\" He grinned and his eyes met mine again. It took me a moment to process what he meant, and as I glanced down, I saw my little reaction. \\n\\n‚ÄúOh, I\\'m so sorry,\"\" I stammered, wrapping my arms. ‚ÄúIt\\'s a bit cold.\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúNo, it isn\\'t.\"\" He chuckled as he grabbed his glass and went to the fridge to pour a drink.  He may have been right, but the arrogant response made me surprise.\\n\\n‚ÄúYes, it is. It\\'s a bit chilly, and well, yeah‚Äî\"\" \\nAs the door to the fridge closed, he turned to face me, sipping from his cup. The movement of his Adam\\'s apple as he drank down the liquid caught my eye. I had never seen something as simple as that look so attractive before.\\n\\n‚ÄúI know what you want, Becca,\"\" he said, grasping my attention once more.\\n\\n‚ÄúI don\\'t want anything,\"\" I replied, trying to play the moment off.\\n\\n‚ÄúEnough.\"\" Setting his cup down, he quickly cleared the space between us once more. \\n\\n‚ÄúMr. Valentino‚Äî\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúI told you to call me James, Becca.\"\" His firm reply flipped the switch on the situation and instantly made me want to behave. ‚ÄúI can see that you get excited, but I can promise you I\\'m not what you want. The things I would do‚Ä¶ well, they would be too much for you.\"\"\\n\\nOh gees. ‚ÄúY-you have no idea what I can handle. You don\\'t know me like that.\"\"\\n\\nMy stuttered response showed clearly how uneasy I was with this situation, and yet I wanted it. \\n\\n‚ÄúBe a good girl, Becca. You need to go upstairs and go to bed,\"\" he whispered as he inhaled deeply and pushed himself back from where we stood. \\n\\nThe distance he was placing between us gave me a chance to breathe once more. Without a moment of hesitation, my feet pushed me towards the stairs, only he stopped me again. \\n\\n‚ÄúRemember what I said,\"\" he all but growled in an amazing way that had frozen me. \\nTurning to face him, I tried to push him away. But the realization hit me that he was within my reach made everything worse. Snapping out of my daydream, I quickly freed myself from his grasp. He was there and he stared at me, making everything harder. \\n\\n‚ÄúGoodnight, Mr. Valentino,\"\" I stuttered, forcing my gaze from his before I turned and fled from the kitchen, quickly running up the stairs.\\n\\nJames Valentino was a mysterious man, and there was no telling what he truly meant by what he\\'d said. Perhaps he was dangerous, but perhaps I would like it.\\nJames.\\n\\n‚ÄúDaniel, as you can see, there are numerous ways we can better help you profit from your industry if you use our company. Our importing and exporting section far surpasses that of our competitors.\"\"\\nI watched as the CEO of Citadel Furnishing thought about my proposal. I had spent months trying to close this deal, and with weeks of back and forth, I knew without a doubt I had this in the bag. A smile lined the man\\'s face as he nodded. ‚ÄúLet\\'s do it,\"\" he replied, holding out his hand, which I quickly shook. \\n\\n‚ÄúI look forward to our future business together. If you wait just a moment, I will have Evette bring in the paperwork for you to sign, and then we will have someone take you on a tour of the docks so you can see our company at its finest.\"\"\\n\\nEvette brought in the paperwork, Daniel signed it, and then I sent him off for the promised tour. Once he was gone, I reached for my phone which had gone off a few different times during my meeting. \\n\\nTally. \\n\\nThe girl was difficult, but as my only child, I loved her no matter what she did. She was the princess in my kingdom, and I was the king of my castle. For years I had tried to correct Tally\\'s behavior, but her mother was always an obstacle.\\n\\n\\'Having people over today for a pool party.\\'\\nShaking my head, I sighed. There was no arguing with this girl.\\n\\'That\\'s fine. I will be home later this afternoon. Do you girls need anything?\\'\\nA few moments passed, and I watched the small bubbles at the bottom of our chat move. \\n\\'We\\'re fine. See.\\'\\nA photo pushed through on my screen, and I smiled at my beautiful daughter, Tally, dressed with a straw hat and cover-up over her bathing suit. She was beautiful, just like her mother.\\n\\'You look beautiful, sweetie. Be safe, see you soon. Xx\\'\\nAs soon as I sent the text, though, another photo came through, and it was one that made me internally groan. My hand was tightening on the phone as I stared down at the smiling face. It was of Becca. My daughter\\'s beautiful friend who was supposed to be off limits.\\n\\nFrom the moment I laid eyes on Becca, I felt something towards her. A curiosity, a hunger that made me want to know more. I knew it was wrong, but god, was she the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her hair was up in a high ponytail, showing off her beauty. A black bathing suit looked very good on her. I enjoyed the sight very much. \\n\\nNever once before did an interest of the girl come across my mind until now, and yet, even though I tried my hardest not to take interest, I couldn\\'t help it. The once ordinary young girl had grown into a beautiful tall brunette with blue eyes and a figure most women would die for.\\n\\nSeeing her the other night in the kitchen was a surprise, but remembering her stretching up into the cabinet, the thought of her made realize how bad I was attracted to her. She was very spectacular, and I wanted nothing more than to be with her. \\n\\nI was not proud with my own thought, but as if my charm prowess took over, it quickly dissipated. I wanted her more than I had ever wanted anyone. I needed to be happy. As if on cue, my office door opened, and in walked a tall blonde with a flashy make-up. Her tight blue dress matches her well, but the problem was she wasn\\'t who I wanted to see. \\n\\n‚ÄúKatrine. To what do I owe the pleasure?\"\"\\nShe smiled as she pushed my chair back and sat next to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhy haven\\'t you come to see me?\"\" Her thick Russian accent washed over me as she leaned back batting her lashes. ‚ÄúI had to wait a week and come see you here.\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúI told you, Katrine, I am busy right now.\"\"\\n\\nHer brows furrowed as she put on a pout which may have worked on most men, but not me. Tally had perfected that look, and I had grown well accustomed to not falling for it.\\n\\n‚ÄúI thought you would miss me,\"\" she whined as I exhaled with irritation.\\nPinching the bridge of my nose, I shook my head and moved away from her.\\n\\n‚ÄúI told you that I don\\'t do the emotions thing, Katrine.\"\" \\nShe looked surprised, and her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúWe have been seeing each other for months‚Äì\"\"\\n\\n‚ÄúYes, and as I told you the first time‚Ä¶ there is nothing else that will happen. It\\'s just fun, Katrine, and you told me you understood that. I don\\'t understand why you came to my company.\"\" \\n\\nWe had one rule, and she knows what it was. \\n\\n‚ÄúYou are mine, James.\"\" Her response was firm as she crossed her arms. ‚ÄúI don\\'t understand why you are acting like this. Don\\'t I make you happy?\"\"\\n\\nIt was clear this conversation wasn\\'t going anywhere, and with my next appointment arriving in less than an hour, I had things I needed to get done. \\n\\n‚ÄúEvette!\"\" I yelled, watching as the door opened to reveal my very punctual assistant.\\n\\n‚ÄúYes, Mr. Valentino?\"\" \\n\\n‚ÄúCan you please escort Katrine to her car?\"\" I asked her, watching as a look of shock crossed Katrine\\'s face.\\n\\n‚ÄúOf course.\"\" Evette reached out to Katrine but was quickly pushed back by the rage that began to build beneath her once enticing eyes.\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you throwing me out?!\"\" she shrieked. ‚ÄúYou can\\'t do this to me!\"\"\\n\\nAmusement filled me as I leaned back in my chair and watched her. That\\'s unattractive. Perhaps this is for the best.\\n\\n‚ÄúI think you will see that I can. I appreciate your attention, Katrine, but they will no longer be needed. I do wish you all the best for the future.\"\"\\n\\nCold. That was how I had to be. I never meant to hurt the women I had relations with, but I couldn\\'t allow them to think it would be more.\\n\\nI was always cast as the bad guy. No matter how many times I told them from the start I didn\\'t want an exclusive relationship, and there would be nothing more than fun, they never listened to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou will regret doing this to me!\"\" Katrine warned, causing me to smile.\\n‚ÄúIs that a threat, Miss Solkova?\"\"\\n\\nLaughing, she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, that\\'s a promise. Karma will get you.\"\"\\nTurning on her heels, she stormed from my office with Evette left to stand there staring at me.\\n\\n‚ÄúMr. Valentino, may I say something?\"\"\\n‚ÄúOf course, Evette. What\\'s on your mind?\"\" I replied.\\n‚ÄúIf I am going to start having to play defense for you when it comes to women like that‚Ä¶ I am going to have to request a raise, bonus, or something.\"\"\\nI laughed at her statement. ‚ÄúIs that right?\"\"\\n‚ÄúYes, sir. Call it hazard pay if you will.\"\" Evette sighed, shaking her head. ‚ÄúWould you like your afternoon coffee, sir?\"\"\\n‚ÄúYes, yes. That would be wonderful. Also, I will take the hazard pay into consideration.\"\"\\n‚ÄúThank you, sir. I will be back in just a moment.\"\"\\n\\nAs the door closed, I couldn\\'t help but laugh to myself at her comment. She wanted hazard pay if she had to deal with the women in my life, and honestly, I didn\\'t blame her.\\n\\nAs the afternoon carried on, I found myself caught within my work. That was, until I started scrolling through my phone looking for a document and came across Becca\\'s photo again. Her beautiful figure and carefree smile‚Ä¶ they captivated me.\\n\\nThe thought of boys at my house partying with my daughter and Becca didn\\'t sit well. I knew the girls were of age, but I didn\\'t like the idea that Becca may take an interest in one of those young men. Especially, since the way she acted around me meant she could want me. Oh god! What\\'s the matter with me? This girl has me all out of sorts.\\n\\n‚ÄúSir, your four o\\'clock appointment is calling to cancel?\"\" my secretary stated from my office door, pulling me from my thoughts.\\n\\n‚ÄúThat\\'s fine. I actually have an emergency that has come up, and I need to go home. See if you can get them to reschedule for me.\"\" \\n\\n‚ÄúOf course, sir. Do you need anything else?\"\"\\n\\nMy eyes met hers briefly, but I did not say a word. It was enough for her to understand I was being serious and close the door, giving me time to think through what I was about to do.\\n\\n‚ÄúPaul,\"\" I said into the receiver of my phone as I called my driver, ‚Äúbring the car around.\"\"\\nIt was time to head home and see how the girls were doing. After all, what kind of responsible adult would I be if I didn\\'t?'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Make Voice For Equal Rights‚ù§Ô∏è\\uf8ffüíõ\\uf8ffüíö\\uf8ffüíô\\uf8ffüíú\\nThere‚Äôs no stopping the spirit of #Pride \\uf8ffüåà\\nSHOP NOW\\uf8ffüè≥‚Äç\\uf8ffüåà>>https://bit.ly/3N2ZIYz'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Make Voice For Equal Rights‚ù§Ô∏è\\uf8ffüíõ\\uf8ffüíö\\uf8ffüíô\\uf8ffüíú\\nThere‚Äôs no stopping the spirit of #Pride \\uf8ffüåà\\nSHOP NOW\\uf8ffüè≥‚Äç\\uf8ffüåà>>https://bit.ly/3oegNUV'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Make Voice For Equal Rights‚ù§Ô∏è\\uf8ffüíõ\\uf8ffüíö\\uf8ffüíô\\uf8ffüíú\\nThere‚Äôs no stopping the spirit of #Pride \\uf8ffüåà\\nSHOP NOW\\uf8ffüè≥‚Äç\\uf8ffüåà>>https://bit.ly/3L20lQw'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Make Voice For Equal Rights‚ù§Ô∏è\\uf8ffüíõ\\uf8ffüíö\\uf8ffüíô\\uf8ffüíú\\nEquality Hurts No One\\uf8ffüëä\\uf8ffüëä\\nSHOP NOW>>https://bit.ly/41xmvzk'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': \"On this week's episode of Socially Democratic, Dunn Street founder and Community Organiser Stephen Donnelly was joined by Executive Director of the Chifley Research Centre, David Epstein.\\n\\nDavid joins the show to chat about his political journey from a Labor household to chief of staff in the Rudd government, to executive director of Labor's official think tank - Chifley Research Centre. \\n\\nDavid discusses the role Chifley plays in the development of policy for the movement and how they will facilitate a robust discussion at the upcoming Labor Fringe in Brisbane, which runs as part of the 2023 ALP National Convention\\n\\nNational Conference plays a defining role in the future of our Party and our nation -  Please join us at the 49th Australian Labor Party National Conference at the Brisbane Convention Centre from Thursday 17 to Saturday 19 August 2023:\\nhttps://laborconference.org.au/ \\nMake your voice heard this ALP Fringe: https://laborfringe.org.au/\\nThe Chifley Research Centre is the official think tank of the Australian Labor Party dedicated to championing a Labor culture of ideas.

And how?\" He asked, taking her picture. \\n\"They found her shopping. But, boss...your ex-wife had triplets in her arms...\" \\n--------------------------------------------------\\n‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Iris asked, shaking her head in question at her husband as she tried to understand why he was angry with her this time. \\nHer husband was packing his things, wanting to leave the house without giving her a proper explanation of what was going on. The two of them did not even argue; therefore, she did not understand what his issue was this time.\\n‚ÄúDean, please don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù She begged, trying to take his hand. Her husband was quick to pull his hand away, glaring at her.\\n‚ÄúI never did love you, and I never will. You and I both know that our marriage was over long before it even started.‚Äù He said, reminding her that their marriage was an arranged one. She had hoped that he would love her by time, she prayed, she fought, she stood strong, tried to lure him in toward her, but nothing worked. The man was as cold as ice when it came to her, and that was something that she failed to realize.\\nShe put her hand on her stomach as she felt it bloat. The last thing she wanted was to lose another pregnancy. This time, Dean didn‚Äôt even know about it, she didn‚Äôt want to give him any hope like she used to only to end up losing him again if she lost another one of his children.\\nShe knew that Dean wouldn‚Äôt touch her if sober and has only slept with her because he was drunk.\\nShe could still remember the night very well. Her husband, the man that she was deeply in love with, had moaned out his mistress‚Äôs name in her ear as he imagined her before coming undone. She could still remember the pain and humiliation that she felt, but she never spoke about it to him. \\nThe next morning, when both woke up, the man didn‚Äôt bother looking at her. He didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the fact that she was in bed.\\n‚ÄúDean, the two of us have tried. I have tried, for years, I have tried to satisfy you. But‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n‚ÄúThen stop.‚Äù He said, stopping her. She looked down at her feet, avoiding his eyes as tears formed in her eyes. She gripped her shirt as she felt weak. The fact that she knew what had to be done was something that she hated. The man has been insisting on them filing a divorce for months now, and he has been wanting it to end in one sitting. The one way to do so was for both of them to agree on this divorce, making it a ‚Äòmutual‚Äô one, and though it killed her inside, she knew that it had to be done. There was no use to fighting for a relationship that was done.\\nThe man didn‚Äôt even want her, and that was something that she knew.\\nShe looked up at the man before wiping her tears, her mind set on the one target that she had in mind. She wanted to keep her child, and she was determined on building her own family. The man may have broken her, he has done it more times than any man has ever done before, and the last thing she wanted was to deal with more of this pain.\\nThankfully, she knew that she had the support of her father, but that didn‚Äôt mean that things were going to be easy. If anything, they were not. Her mother was not going to like the fact that she had agreed to a divorce. The woman believed that every marriage had its conflicts, and that everything had a solution.\\nBut Iris knew it for fact, this marriage was over, and whether or not her mother liked it; she was not going to proceed with it. If she was to raise her child in a sane environment, then she had to ensure that she created it for the baby first, and therefore, choosing to leave was going to be the best option.\\nShe was to raise her baby as far away as she could from all these dark memories, and one day, if her child chose to want to see their father, she would be more than welcoming to allow the idea. The man didn‚Äôt even care that he had broken her heart as he turned to his things, fixing them in his suitcase. She knew that he was going to that woman, his mistress, the woman who has somehow managed to earn his heart. Ariana.\\n‚ÄúYou wanted to file for a divorce?‚Äù She asked, making Dean frown in confusion. He stopped packing his things, and turned to face her, clearly surprised with what she was asking.\\nHis chest ached for a second, and he felt like his breath got caught in his throat. The man nodded, crossing his arms over his chest as he waited to hear what she had to say. She put her hand on her chest, ignoring the pain that she was feeling in the pit of her stomach and her chest. She had to stand strong to fend for her baby. A heartbreak was not going to do her any good, and the constant arguing was only going to end up breaking her.\\n‚ÄúI remember that you had copies of the papers before? You wanted me to sign them.‚Äù She said, keeping her eyes on his, ignoring all the pain that she felt at that very moment as her heart begged her not to do this. She knew that she had to, for her baby, heart, and sanity, she had to do this. Dean studied her expression, unsure of what to say before he nodded.\\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He said, regretting it almost instantly. He knew that she was well aware that he had them. There was no use lying about it now.\\n‚ÄúI will sign them and get out of your life, Dean Andino.‚Äù  She said, looking him dead in the eye, ‚Äúso, please, do give them to me. Let us end this marriage mutually‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n......5 years later......\\nIris:\\n‚ÄúLilian, that is enough.‚Äù I said, scolding my daughter who was trying to be stubborn. A habit that she seems to have developed since we came here.\\nShe has been refusing to allow me to put on her shirt for the past half an hour and has been trying to escape me since. I hated admitting it, but she was as stubborn as her father was.\\n‚ÄúBut, mama, I don‚Äôt like this shirt.‚Äù She said, pouting her lips. \\nI sighed and put the shirt down before taking her hands in mine, pulling her to my chest. It was something that I always did when she was having a fit. Trying to understand her often helped, though sometimes I even failed to do that. I still tried my best.\\n‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt like this shirt, nor did you like the other twenty shirts that I pulled out.‚Äù I said, teasing her. She giggled and shook her head at me before putting her hand in her mouth. \\nI was thankful for her being in my life, she was a blessing to me that made all the struggles that I have been through with my ex worthwhile. At least I knew that my little princess wasn‚Äôt in a toxic place where the two of us were constantly fighting, and I knew that she was somewhat happy in the life that she was living. \\n‚ÄúIs there anything that is bothering you, my little princess?‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to school.‚Äù She said, and I smiled. It was her first day at preschool, and she has been giving me a hard time since last night. \\nAt least now I understand why. The fact that she didn‚Äôt want to go anywhere where kids were with both their parents was something that I was somewhat used to, and though it did sometimes hurt me to know that I didn‚Äôt do enough to fulfill my role as the mother and father figures in her life, I couldn‚Äôt blame her. \\n‚ÄúCan you tell me why you don‚Äôt want to go to school? Are you afraid of not fitting in?‚Äù I asked, trying to be as gentle as I could be with her. \\nBut she had the same attitude on her third day at her daycare, and when I asked what happened, it was her teacher who explained to me that she felt different when she realized that most of the kids had both their parents with them, and that she only came with me. It killed me inside that I had to separate her from her father, but I knew since that day that things wouldn‚Äôt have been the same.\\n‚ÄúWhy do other kids have a daddy and I don‚Äôt?‚Äù She asked, making my chest ache. \\nHow could I explain to a four year old that her father never bothered giving me a chance to begin with? I tried to shower her with the love that any daughter could get, but I wasn‚Äôt her father, and I knew that no matter how hard I would try to be, I was never going to be. \\n‚ÄúYou do have a daddy, sweetheart, and one day, very close, I will be sure that the two of you reunite again. For now, I just need you to be a little patient.‚Äù I said, my voice softening as I ran my hand over her cheek.\\nAs much as I hated what happened between us, I never did try to make her hate her father. In her eyes, he was the hero that she wanted to meet. I just didn‚Äôt know how that was going to be possible right now.\\nThe two of us have been living in Orlando since she was born, and my parents would visit every once and a while, but now, considering that it has been almost five years since I left; therefore, I believed that it was time to go back. I had my businesses to tend to, and with my father growing ill by the day, I knew that I had to start taking care of them. It was one of the reasons why I was going back to begin with. The one issue that I had was knowing that Dean was a main partner. Just the idea of having to see him in a meeting or gathering was something that I feared, but I knew that it was about time to face him. I couldn‚Äôt keep running away from him for life, right?\\nLilian kept her eyes on mine, studying my expression for a few seconds before she nodded. She often knew when she was giving me a hard time and when she wasn‚Äôt, and she knew that she was. She looked at her shirts for a few seconds before pulling the pink one that I wanted to put on her. Thankfully, she had a white bateau on, otherwise, I would have worried about her growing sick. Especially considering the fact that it was November.\\n‚ÄúDo you want to choose your coat? Or are you going to be giving mommy a hard time again?‚Äù I asked, teasing my daughter who giggled, clearly amused by what she did. \\nShe knew that she mostly didn‚Äôt get in trouble. In truth, I rarely ever thought of punishing her. In my head, she was my little princess, and I was there to spoil her. The last thing that I wanted was for her to be scared of me or to want to be away from me.\\nIf anything, I had taught her at a young age to come and tell me everything. I would be there by her side, backing her up, even if I had to scold her sometimes if I knew that she did something bad. But the last thing I wanted was for her and I to have the same relationship that I had with my mother.\\nIt was one that was almost nonexistent, and I knew that it was one of the reasons why Dean and I never worked out.\\nThe man didn‚Äôt respect me as he saw that my family didn‚Äôt. The man saw me as weak and unwanted, and though our marriage was initially arranged, the two of us could have managed to work a few things out, I believed it. But things somehow backfired on me when he heard a conversation between my mother and I, and somewhere deep inside me, I knew that we would never be able to be one.\\nThe gap had been created that night, and it was all because of that argument. It was an argument that sent him off to finding his peace elsewhere, and that is something that I can never forget. It is something that I personally would have never wanted; however, he chose not to listen, and she chose to pressure me. Both sides ended up breaking me badly, but nevertheless, I knew that it might have happened for a reason, and I hoped that it was a good one.\\n‚ÄúI want the white one, please. The one with the yellow smiley face.‚Äù She said, and I smiled and nodded. I took her hand in mine and gently kissed her palm.\\n‚ÄúRight away, my little princes.‚Äù\\n............\\nDean:\\n‚ÄúYou seem distracted, my love.‚Äù My wife, Mariana, said, breaking my train of thoughts.\\nThe amount of work that I had was overwhelming, and despite her knowing about it, she didn‚Äôt seem to really care. If anything, all she cared about was what she gained and what she was going to benefit, something that I found both selfish and annoying, but now was not the time to argue about it.\\nI looked at her over my shoulder, choosing not to want to respond. I had to work to tend to and the last thing I needed was for her and I to be arguing. And considering the fact that I knew that our conversation was going to end up turning into an argument to begin with, spoke a lot about how our marriage has been going over the past few years.\\nIt has been five years since our marriage, and in this marriage, I came to believe that the two of us were indeed not fit for one another. \\nThe anger that I felt toward myself for letting go of a person who I knew was perfect for me was something that I could not deny; however, it was also something that I could not admit. I made my choice despite being warned and given the option not to go through with it, it was me who fought all the odds to simply be with a woman who saw me as nothing but a bank account for her to use.\\nIt said more than a little that the two of us, despite being married for a long while and being together before it, didn‚Äôt bother starting a family. She did open up about it once, wanting to stabilize herself with me as a wife when everyone turned their backs on her or ended up showing her that she didn‚Äôt fit. However, I had to admit, it was me who resented it and didn‚Äôt want it with her.\\n‚ÄúDean, you have been off for months now and this is really getting out of hand.‚Äù Mariana said, breaking my train of thoughts. \\nI took a deep breath, controlling my anger before turning around to face her. There was no point in upsetting her now, the woman that I wanted to get back to, my flower, was nowhere to be seen. I have fought for years to find her, but I wasn‚Äôt stupid, she was not in the city and did not want to be found; I would have found a trace of her otherwise.\\nHer father and I still worked together, and though I knew that he was disappointed and angry with me for breaking his daughter‚Äôs heart, the man chose to keep a professional distance between us. The man and I didn‚Äôt bring up the old issues, nor did he lash out on me once; however, he didn‚Äôt allow me to say his daughter‚Äôs name. It was something that I couldn‚Äôt blame him for. The woman did fight for me, it wasn‚Äôt something that I could deny. It was me who chose to resent and kick her out. It wasn‚Äôt her fault at all.\\n‚ÄúI have a lot to deal with, Mariana.‚Äù I said, cupping her cheeks, gently running my finger over them. \\nI knew that she would end up causing an issue, and could even come to the company with that issue, and that was not something that I wanted. I didn‚Äôt need to see her in the building today, I knew that I would end up acting badly and that wasn‚Äôt something that I didn‚Äôt want. \\n‚ÄúYou know the stress of work tends to get to me at times, and with the number of things that I have to deal with right now, I really need a break. Please don‚Äôt ask me too many questions that I don‚Äôt want to answer. I know that you want to help but, Mariana, my love, I need to be able to solve them on my own.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI am here to support you, my love, but if you don‚Äôt open up to me to allow me to do so‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n‚ÄúMariana, the two of us are already aware that the two of us have our own worlds. And I for one do not like sharing my world of work nor do I like mixing it with my house.‚Äù I said, stopping her. \\nThe fact that she was initially my secretary meant many rumors had spread when I got a divorce and married her a month later. It was something that cost me a lot when it came to employees who have been fired for not respecting her, and to investors who chose to withdraw their stocks as they feared losing them considering that Iris‚Äôs father is my partner. \\nThankfully, the man was kind enough not to ruin my business for me as he kept going with the partnership, and though he didn‚Äôt mention it, I knew that it was Iris who might have spoken to him about it.\\nSome, if not most, said that she was the reason behind our divorce. Iris never answered them, and that came as a surprise. The woman simply claimed that it was a mutual divorce agreement, and though that wasn‚Äôt the case, she chose not to ruin my name.\\nIt was something that I knew that Mariana wouldn‚Äôt do. Mariana would do her best to ruin me, my reputation, and family. But Iris proved to me that she wouldn‚Äôt harm me if it cost her everything, and I knew that our divorce has cost her a lot. If anything, it initially cost her the pain that she has put me through. It was something that I hated about myself, but I never tried changing it.\\n‚ÄúIt seems to me like you forgot that I was initially your secretary. If anyone would know how your work goes, Dean, it is me.‚Äù She said, crossing her arms over her chest. \\nI rolled my eyes and walked to the bathroom, ignoring her attitude. The last thing I needed was to argue with her right now. It was bad enough that she was starting to ask me about the two of us conceiving. At first, it was me who wanted this. I wanted the two of us to build a family and I wanted to have an heir.\\nBut the closer we get together, the more I resent the idea of building a family. And I couldn‚Äôt understand the reason behind it. Maybe my attraction toward her was just the fact that it was forbidden. But when we made it real, things just went crazy. The two of us just lost the fling between us, and that was not something that I could easily admit.\\n‚ÄúThat was in the past, Mariana. It is something that the two of us know.‚Äù I said, not bothering to look at her. I could tell that she was shaking her head at me behind me, but that was not something I cared about. I had work to tend to, and that was something that I knew; therefore, this marriage drama was not one that I was looking into.\\nI frowned as my phone rang, and I raised an eyebrow at the fact that it was my secretary. The woman never dared to call me when I was at home. It was due to Mariana scaring her not to do so. The threats that the woman got prevented her from thinking of looking at me rather than speaking to me.\\nIf anything, the woman didn‚Äôt dare speak to me unless it was strictly work behavior, and I couldn‚Äôt blame Mariana for it. The woman was afraid that she would repeat the same past that she made Iris live through and that was something that I knew very well. It was something that I chose to excuse her for and for that, I walked out of the bedroom to take the call.\\n‚ÄúTell me, Sienna?‚Äù I asked, not bothering to greet the woman. I never did greet her anyway, so she wasn‚Äôt surprised by my response.\\n‚ÄúBoss, the men found her.‚Äù She said, and I frowned in confusion. \\nHer next words took me off guard, making my heart drop to the stomach before I felt my breath getting caught in my throat. ‚ÄúThey found your ex, Ms. Iris‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\uf8ffüò≠\\uf8ffüò≠\\nInstall the APP to search for the title\\n\"A Baby for The CEO.‚Äù‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è'}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Joey Dakota‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\n‚ÄúSir, the polls from the primaries are looking just fine. If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,‚Äù the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, ‚ÄúThen LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúLPP!‚Äù Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, ‚ÄúLiberalism to all!‚Äù\\n\\nHe was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,‚Äù I slapped the secretary on his back, ‚ÄúCongratulations to us all.‚Äù\\n\\nStanding at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people‚Äôs party and run for the governorship of Florida.\\n\\nThe idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‚Äòa notorious playboy‚Äô.\\n\\nSecond, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn‚Äôt count as an experience.\\n\\nAt the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don‚Äôt know who was more shocked, myself or the public.\\n\\nBut somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.\\n\\nWhen I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male‚Äôs interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6‚Äôam? Close to Nil.\\n\\nIt was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.\\n\\n‚ÄúThis is working out.‚Äù My vice governor cheered.\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.\\n\\n11:30 am.\\n\\n‚Äòdang!‚Äô I cursed under my breath, ‚ÄúThis meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.‚Äù I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù\\n\\nHe addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.\\n\\nThe room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.\\n\\nThe noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.\\n\\n‚ÄúIs there a problem Laura?‚Äù I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.\\n\\nHer dark brows knitting, she turned to me, ‚ÄúSir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.‚Äù\\n\\nI arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, ‚ÄúCan it wait till I‚Äôm done at Kota?‚Äù\\n\\nShe shook her head, ‚ÄúNo sir. It can‚Äôt. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúFine, out with it.‚Äù Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.\\n\\nShe glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n\\nThe rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that darned organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.\\n\\nWife.\\n\\nThe word left a bitter taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.\\n\\nA wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we discuss this at the next meeting?‚Äù\\n\\nLaura‚Äôs eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, ‚ÄúThe primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúBut I thought Mr. Dakota was married?‚Äù an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.\\n\\n‚ÄúIf you all don‚Äôt know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don‚Äôt know what the heck you are doing in here campaigning for him!‚Äù she snapped.\\n\\n‚ÄúAs Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.‚Äù I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.\\n\\nMy jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.\\n\\n‚ÄúPlease wait, hold the elevator.‚Äù\\n\\nI lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.\\n\\nMy annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThe single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.\\n\\nAll thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.\\n\\nHer golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she‚Äôd look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.\\n\\nSuddenly she reached for her camera.\\n\\nA Reporter.\\n\\nI inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I‚Äôd figured, they were nothing but trouble.\\n\\nStriding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nKimberly Scott‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\nSavage and fierce.\\n\\nDevastatingly sexy.\\n\\nHis heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!\\n\\nI snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.\\n\\nJoey Dakota.\\n\\nCEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People‚Äôs Party.\\n\\nA hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.\\n\\nHow atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.\\n\\nJoey Dakota is no different.\\n\\nAfter his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics‚Äîaka stealing from the public.\\n\\nIt was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‚ÄòSerial heartbreaker.‚Äô\\n\\nHe had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.\\n\\nImpulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‚Äòclicking‚Äô sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.\\n\\n‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I rush at him, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing? You can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù\\n\\nBut he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.\\n\\nThat could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.\\n\\nI bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, ‚ÄúHOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.‚Äù\\n\\nIt was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.\\n\\nHe removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent?  reporters.‚Äù he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.\\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a reporter. And weren‚Äôt you taught how to be courteous to strangers?‚Äù I retorted, ‚ÄúI guess not. Your mother wasn‚Äôt there to teach you manners.‚Äù\\n\\nI watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ‚ÄòOh dang!‚Äô I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.\\n\\nI quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‚ÄòDing‚Äô and I felt my heart plop into my belly.\\n\\nHe turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù\\n\\nHis voice could cut glass.\\n\\nCelebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything‚Ä¶maybe ‚Ä¶. Murder?\\n\\n‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.\\n\\nI slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me‚Äîa good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.\\n\\nA cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.\\n\\nThe slap never came.\\n\\nCracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, ‚ÄúYou thought I was going to hit you?‚Äù his voice was quiet. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù\\n\\nI held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.\\n\\nI stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn‚Äôt tell him or anyone at all.\\n\\nI was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.\\n\\nI shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.\\n\\n‚ÄúI would never hit a woman,‚Äù he mused softly, ‚ÄúI only broke the stupid storage card.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYOU DID WHAT?‚Äù I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.\\n\\nAngry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.\\n\\nThat card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.\\n\\nAn image of a woman‚Äôs pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt was my only hope in paying for my mother‚Äôs hospital bills.\\n\\nOne would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.\\n\\nLife had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.\\n\\nNeither of us expected the stage four bare cancer that took over my mother‚Äôs previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.\\n\\nShe got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.\\n\\nI rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.\\n\\nJust as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.\\n\\nMy knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.\\n\\nI felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.\\n\\nHis arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn‚Äôt be this trembling mess in his arms.\\n\\n‚ÄúHey, Hey‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù\\n\\nI could hear the blood passing through my ears‚Äîthump, thump, thump‚Äîand saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.\\n\\nI fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you claustrophobic?‚Äù now that he wasn‚Äôt holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.\\n\\nI nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn‚Äôt see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since‚Ä¶ I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.\\n\\nI fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.\\n\\nSuddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, ‚ÄúYou are having a panic attack Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and I croaked, ‚ÄúKim... Call me Kim.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI need you to focus on the sound of my voice,‚Äù His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.\\n\\n‚ÄúBreath Kim,‚Äù he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.\\n\\nI tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou are dying.‚Äù A voice in my head said, ‚ÄúThis was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.‚Äù\\n\\nAs if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, ‚ÄúYou are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim‚Ä¶Breath.‚Äù\\n\\nHis voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.\\n\\nMy palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.\\n\\nI felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, ‚ÄúWe are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.‚Äù\\n\\nMy breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.\\n\\nSoon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn‚Äôt make any sense of the one-sided conversation.\\n\\nHe shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, ‚Äúis it better now?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.\\n\\nNow that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn‚Äôt matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.\\n\\nSuddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\nMy eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.\\n\\ndang!\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nJoey‚Äôs P.O.V\\n\\nWhy the screw did they come here?\\n\\nI jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.\\n\\nAs if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.\\n\\nThe doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.\\n\\n reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.\\n\\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn‚Äôt felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.\\n\\nA ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.\\n\\nI‚Äôm surprised the spit-fire hasn‚Äôt threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I‚Äôve been staring at her.\\n\\nThe elevator doors pinged.\\n\\nThe top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.\\n\\nWaving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim‚Äôs hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.‚Äù\\n\\nShe shook her head, ‚ÄúGive me one reason I shouldn‚Äôt head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!‚Äù\\n\\nTaken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYou destroyed my  storage card.‚Äù Her eyes shone, ‚ÄúIt had everything in it. Everything!‚Äù\\n\\nShe enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe are kind of in the middle of something,‚Äù I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.\\n\\nThankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.\\n\\nLaurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt brief me that a conference might be held.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.‚Äù\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nSomehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.\\n\\nTheir voices yelled over each other.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, ‚ÄúAs you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.‚Äù His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.\\n\\nI felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.\\n\\nClearly, this wasn‚Äôt her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since‚Ä¶I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet me take it from here,‚Äù I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.\\n\\nAll eyes riveted on me, ‚ÄúAs Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,‚Äù there was a low chorus of laughter, ‚Äúand there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù Came from the throng.\\n\\nTightening my hold on Kim‚Äôs trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.\\n\\nRipping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.‚Äù Her voice was breathless.\\n\\nA smile tipped the side of my face, ‚ÄúIt gets better with time.‚Äù\\n\\nShe snapped her head up and glared at me, ‚ÄúHow does THAT get any better?‚Äù her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.\\n\\nI walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.\\n\\nI handed her one and took a sip from mine, ‚ÄúBecause you get used to it.‚Äù\\n\\nShe gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.\\n\\nA hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank  God.\\n\\nI just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.\\n\\nMy jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I  missed the meeting.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.\\n\\nShe jolted as she saw me standing by the door, ‚ÄúSir? I thought you left.‚Äù\\n\\nI shook my head, ‚ÄúThe elevator broke down.‚Äù\\n\\nIt wouldn‚Äôt be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.\\n\\nShe nodded slowly in understanding.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I‚Äôd lose that one.‚Äù She glanced at a note in her hand.\\n\\nI scowled, staring down at my ex-wife‚Äôs name scribbled on the paper, ‚ÄúAnything important?\\n\\n‚ÄúThe usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.‚Äù\\n\\nI crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.\\n\\nThen changing the topic, she pointed at the door, ‚ÄúThey finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured distractedly.\\n\\nI reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, ‚ÄúKimberly Scott?‚Äù\\n\\nI had momentarily forgotten that I wasn‚Äôt alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura‚Äôs wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim replied hesitantly, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, ‚ÄúI am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.‚Äù\\n\\nLegend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?\\n\\nA loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou must give me an autograph,‚Äù Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, ‚ÄúThis is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.‚Äù\\n\\nThe latter it is then.\\n\\nKim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.\\n\\nA few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‚ÄòI hadn‚Äôt been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.\\n\\nShe took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, ‚ÄúThank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?‚Äù\\n\\nShe nodded, somewhat embarrassed, ‚ÄúOf course, you can.‚Äù\\n\\nLaura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, ‚ÄúUh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.‚Äù\\n\\nShe was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.\\n\\nHelping her out of her misery, I cut in, ‚ÄúYou never told me you were such a big shot,‚Äù I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.\\n\\nBut her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, ‚ÄúYeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‚Äòbig shot.‚Äô Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.‚Äù\\n\\nI didn‚Äôt hear a word she said.\\n\\nHer eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, ‚ÄúDo you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?‚Äù I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.\\n\\nOur eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.\\n\\nLaura immediately chipped in, ‚ÄúKim, you haven‚Äôt published a photo since the last one. Why‚Ä¶?‚Äù she trailed off.\\n\\nKim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, ‚ÄúI have other things taking my time now.‚Äù Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, ‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.\\n\\nAt her exit, Laura sighed, ‚Äúyou must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‚Äòan angel.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúAnd what did the media term me as, ‚ÄúDevil?‚Äù I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúThey would be right if they did.‚Äù\\n\\nI snorted.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Narrowing my eyes, I asked, ‚ÄúI know that look, Laura.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI think I might know what we have to do to get you a bride before the primaries.‚Äù\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"\\nAGAINST HER WILL‚Äù\\uf8ffü§©\\uf8ffü§©'}, {'Label': 1, 'text': \"I'm Peta Betts, your Nationals candidate for Murray. \\nOur whole electorate needs a positive and constructive voice to fight for what we deserve. \\nOn March 25, vote 1 Peta Betts.\"}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Chip in to help NSW One Nation today.

He was sporting a suit three shades darker than his eyes, a white shirt underneath unbuttoned at the very top. His blond locks were combed back to perfection, framing his face.\\n\\nI lift a shoulder in a shrug, my knife cutting through the grilled Branzino on my plate. ‚ÄúYou know Katerina Simone?‚Äù I asked, and brought my fork to my mouth. I moaned at the unbelievable taste of piquant basil, ginger, and lime. When I opened my eyes, Kyle was observing me, eyes dilated with an emotion I could not point out. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I wiped my mouth with the napkin.\\n\\nAdam‚Äôs apple bobbing up and down, he reached for his wine.\\n\\n‚ÄúStop moaning like that,‚Äù he said, lips hovering over his gltootshie.\\n\\nI bit my lip, cheeks warming up.\\n\\nKyle and I had been together for two years and engaged for one, yet he never failed to make me blush.\\n\\nTucking my hair behind my ears, I reached for my own drink. His heated gaze made my mouth dry. He stared at me as though he couldn‚Äôt wait to strip this little black dress I‚Äôm wearing.\\n\\nHoping to get my mind back on track, I took in the fancy accent and framed artwork lining the wall. We are in one of the swankiest restaurants in Boston. Words go around that reservations here could take about a month or two, yet I doubt Kyle waited that long. Being one of Boston‚Äôs most sought out defense lawyers, Kyle was used to dining in places like this.\\n\\n‚ÄúKaterina, Fernando Simone‚Äôs daughter?‚Äù he asked.\\n\\nDark midnight eyes held my gaze, a promise that this night would end better than the lemon pie for our dessert. I was so distracted by the way he was looking at me I‚Äôd forgotten what we were talking about.\\n\\n‚ÄúShe walked into the office and specifically looked for me. She said,‚Äù I made a quotation in the air, ‚Äú‚ÄòGia told me you are the best in this field. I need you to work for me.‚Äô It was really weird since Gia Marquez, and I didn‚Äôt see eye to eye when I was working with her.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù Kyle murmured, brows tilting to the ceiling.\\n\\nI hummed a yes.\\n\\nFor the last four years, I crawled up the ladder of Lewis Brown Public Relations from Intern to Account Coordinator and got promoted to Account Executive two years ago. On record, Gia Marquez is the most challenging client our team has ever handled. It‚Äôs funny how she could say a good word about me when she cursed me and my roots when I worked with her. She was a total larker, coming from old money, just like Katerina.\\n\\nShaking my head at the memory, I set down my gltootshie with a sigh.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou accepted her,‚Äù Kyle commented. It‚Äôs one thing I love about Kyle. He can read me like the back of his hand. A crease in my brows, a sigh, a pout. I don‚Äôt know how he does that, but he just gets me.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù I traced the mouth of my gltootshie with my fingers, shoulders slouching. ‚ÄúGeorgia gave me two choices: accept Katerina or take this billionaire client in Rio.‚Äù\\n\\nGeorgia, my senior account executive, candidly dislikes me for unknown reasons.\\n\\nKyle reached across the table, taking my hand. He stroked my knuckles with his thumb. ‚ÄúYou made it this far, and this is your dream job. Don‚Äôt let Georgia stop you from reaching your goal.‚Äù Our eyes locked, and his sincerity caressed my heart the way his thumb did to my knuckles. ‚ÄúI know a good way to help you relax,‚Äù he smirked.\\n\\nLike an obedient puppy, my mind instantly shoved away what worries it was constructing. I gripped Kyle‚Äôs hand, tilting it up, my fingertips tracing his palm lines. Pressing both elbows on the table, I lowered my voice and asked, ‚Äúoh yeah?‚Äù\\n\\nHe huffed, setting down his empty gltootshie and catching my wandering fingers. ‚ÄúSounds like you are challenging me, Baby Girl.‚Äù\\n\\nOh, he‚Äôs in the mood.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nKyle shaved a good five minutes off from what typically takes a thirty minute drive from the city to his upstate mansion. After parking unceremoniously at the roundabout, Kyle slid out, opened the door for me, and basically plucked me from my seat. He trapped me against the door after shutting it with a thud, plowing his fingers through my hair, smashing our lips together. His soft lips tasted of wine with a pinch of lemon pie.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou will be sick tomorrow,‚Äù he said, biting my lower lip, his hard-on pressing on my hip bone.\\n\\nMind fogged with lust, I pulled away to confirm if I had heard him correctly. ‚ÄúAre you a mind reader now, Atty. Andrews?‚Äù\\n\\nHe gripped my jaw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll screwing ruin you tonight, Sofia,‚Äù he stated, eyes skimming down my body. ‚ÄúYou know I go crazy seeing your legs like this, yet you chose this sinfully short dress on a workday date night.‚Äù\\n\\nI swallowed hard. Empty promises were not Kyle‚Äôs forte. Georgia would kill me if I called in sick on a Wednesday, especially after taking on an important client like Katerina.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I had in mind when I chose this.‚Äù I clutched the lapel of his suit.\\n\\nKyle groaned, gripping my hand. In a handful of steps, we are inside his mansion. Kyle yanked me to face him, grabbed my jaw, and smashed our lips together. He groaned impatiently as I parted my lips, letting him deepen the kiss. He kept steering us through the house until my butt bumped into a hard edge.\\n\\nWith the help of the warm corner lights, I realized he had brought us to the kitchen, my back resting on the edge of the kitchen island.\\n\\n‚ÄúTell me you‚Äôre mine.‚Äù He kissed his way down my throat, palming my bare with one hand, the other reaching for the side zipper of my dress.\\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours, all yours,‚Äù I said, gasping as the cool wind blasted my skin, following the ripping sound of my dress.\\n\\nKyle‚Äôs demonstration of strength stirred my excitement to a new height. He spun me around with an impatient growl, skipping all foreplay. He ripped my black thongs, the ruined fabric joining my dress around my feet. The fumbling of his belt was music to my ears. Warm hands trailed down my spine, guiding me to bend over the island.\\n\\nAnd there, Kyle proved he was a man of his word; the ruining comment might have been an understatement. He marked me, owned me just like every time we were together.\\n\\nThrough the desire overdose, we reached his bedroom and slept in each other‚Äôs arms, spent yet satisfied.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night, I woke up with a dire need to pee. When I went back to bed, the continuous blinking of Kyle‚Äôs phone on the nightstand grabbed my attention.\\n\\nThinking it was an emergency, I neared the bed to wake him up. My body froze when I saw the notification on his locked screen.\\n\\n‚ÄòI warned you, Kyle.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell her myself if you can‚Äôt.‚Äô\\n\\nCuriosity getting the best of me, I unlocked his phone with my birthday; what I read ruined me, indeed.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAre you sure it‚Äôs mine?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAre you calling me a liar? Babies happen when you have sex, Kyle. And we did more than just have sex. We screwed!‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòYou sound so sure I am the father. I don‚Äôt remember a screwing thing about that night!‚Äô I gathered through my blurry sight. It was Kyle‚Äôs response to the image of a pregnancy test result.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs ironic how parallel lines could light up the future I had built with Kyle in flames and turn it to ash.\\n\\nI couldn‚Äôt breathe. There seemed to be an oxygen shortage inside the room. My chest caved as questions filled my head. ‚ÄòWhat the heck is happening? Kyle? My Kyle. My fiance got another woman pregnant?‚Äô\\n\\nReaching the end of the thread that started more than a month ago, I finally had the guts to look at the display profile on the chat.\\n\\nA strangled sob escaped my lips. I covered my mouth, my hand touching my wet cheeks.\\n\\nIt was Katerina Simone.\\n\\nMy fiance was the father of her child. Behind closed doors, she told Georgia and me what kind of service she‚Äôd require from us.\\n\\n‚ÄòI am pregnant,‚Äô Katerina said. ‚ÄòAnd I don‚Äôt want the public to know about my pregnancy until after my wedding.‚Äô\\n\\nAt LBPR, we live for these kinds of stories. You‚Äôd be surprised at the cost people would pay to maintain their perfect image.\\n\\n‚ÄòTheir names are worth more than their fortune,‚Äô that‚Äôs what Chairman Lewis used to say.\\n\\nIn this case, Katerina has more than an image to protect. She chose me with intent. It‚Äôs not because of my excellent work at keeping Gia Marquez‚Äôs secret relationship with a governor. By coming to me, she made a statement to Kyle.\\n\\n‚ÄúBabe,‚Äù Kyle‚Äôs sleep-laced voice snapped me out of my trance.\\n\\nI lifted my gaze to him, not even bothering to wipe my tears.\\n\\nHe opened the bedside lamp, rubbing the sleep off his eyes. It took him about five seconds to take in my appearance.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhy are you crying?‚Äù His eyes landed on my hand, clutching his phone. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with you and Katerina?‚Äù I‚Äôd like to give myself a pat on the back for not stuttering.\\n\\nA tag of war was happening inside my head. One part believed that he would never do this to me. And the other tells me to wake the screw up; the evidence was ready to bite me in the face.\\n\\nHe sat on the edge of the bed and took his phone, brows creasing as he scanned what was on display.\\n\\nI clenched my fist. The sadness in my chest was slowly morphing into anger. A black hole was quickly sucking the future I dreamt of building with him. The kids, the waking up together and coming home to each other every night‚Ä¶ This was the man I was supposed to marry.\\n\\n‚ÄòHow did this happen to us?‚Äô\\n\\nHe was my end game, or so I thought.\\n\\nHe placed his phone on the nightstand, stretched to his full height, and reached for me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it seems.‚Äù\\n\\nI snorted, wiggling my hand from his grip, but it was to no avail. He hooked a finger beneath my chin, forcing me to look up at him. The reticent light in his room revealed his pleading blue eyes. ‚ÄúBaby, let me explain.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúExplain what? Everything I needed to know was in that conversation.‚Äù My entire body was trembling. A tsunami of emotions spiraled down my spine. ‚ÄúYou woke up next to her, bare‚Ä¶ in your childhood bedroom. She‚Äôs two months pregnant, and you kept all of this from me!‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúBaby, I don‚Äôt remember that night. I was screwing wasted,‚Äù he said, skimming his hand over his face. The realness of the situation made breathing a struggle. Kyle has always been tootshieertive, and he is anything but a light weight. How could I believe a word he was saying?\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you sure you didn‚Äôt screw her because she sounds so screwing sure, Kyle?‚Äù Those words left a bitter taste on my tongue.\\n\\nHis silence was my answer. I took a sharp breath, stepping away from him as though his proximity was suffocating me.\\n\\nKyle exhaled. I hate that he still looked calm and collected while here I am, a crying mess. ‚ÄúJust give me time. I will fix this situation.‚Äù\\n\\nI faced him. ‚ÄúHow can you fix this situation, Kyle, huh? I bet your mom would be ecstatic to know about Katerina‚Äôs pregnancy.‚Äù\\n\\nHe lowered his head, blowing a deep breath. ‚ÄúShe already knows, doesn‚Äôt she?‚Äù\\n\\nSince he introduced me to his family, his mom‚Äôs animosity towards me was as clear as a cloudless sky. Kyle‚Äôs family came from old money. And being the only son of a lawyer and a doctor, his mom wanted him to marry one of her amiga‚Äôs daughters. ‚ÄòA girl from high society,‚Äô she once blatantly said in my face, not some publicist working nine to five.\\n\\nI wiped my tears. ‚ÄúI bet she‚Äôs already planning your wedding with Katerina.‚Äù\\n\\nKyle reached for me, but I stepped back. ‚ÄúSofia... you‚Äôre the one I want to marry. Please, don‚Äôt do this to us. I will figure something out.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who did this to us! I love you, but this is too much. I need space. I need time to think.‚Äù\\n\\nSomething dangerous crossed his face. ‚ÄúIf you leave now, I won‚Äôt be chasing you.‚Äù\\n\\nOf all the things he‚Äôd say, that line never crossed my mind.\\n\\n‚ÄúMom threatened to disown me if I didn‚Äôt marry Katerina. And you leaving me this way...‚Äù his long lash gaze pierced my soul when he met my eyes. ‚ÄúI have nothing left to lose.‚Äù\\n\\nMy mouth ran dry. How could he reverse the situation as if I were the one ending this relationship? I am not the one who slept with Katerina!\\n\\n‚ÄúI was ready to give up everything for you... if you leave me now, you will lose me forever.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúAre you seriously giving me an ultimatum?‚Äù\\n\\nHe raked his hair roughly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been fighting for this relationship, Sofia. All I am asking is time to fix this, and you can‚Äôt even give me that.‚Äù\\n\\nConfrontations had always been Kyle‚Äôs expertise. He could twist the law in his sleep. He always finds a loophole, and he‚Äôs using that to his advantage.\\n\\nMy anger got the best of me. I jutted my chin up, meeting his gaze defiantly. ‚ÄúWell, you don‚Äôt have to fight for anything anymore, Kyle.‚Äù\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe sun is not up yet. I glanced left to right on the empty street, shifting from one foot to another. This is the last place I‚Äôd see myself after breaking my engagement off.\\n\\nDrawing in a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell to Georgia‚Äôs place. The silence of this neighborhood was sullen, and her footsteps as she approached the door were like a drum roll to the plot twist of my story.\\n\\n‚ÄúThis better be a life and death-‚Äú her sleep-laced voice halted as she took in my appearance. ‚ÄúWhat the heck happened to you, Sofia?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I glanced down at Kyle‚Äôs shirt and joggers. They swallow my small frame like a blanket. My hair was a tangled mess, no less, and my face was no better. ‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù\\n\\nWithout missing a beat, she stepped aside and allowed me in.\\n\\nShe led me to the kitchen. I sat on the stool by the breakfast bar while Georgia busied herself on the coffee machine. As the machine purred gently, she faced me and crossed her arms. ‚ÄúYou are here for a reason.‚Äù\\n\\nI sighed. Georgia is the last person I‚Äôd confide in about my problems. We are not friends. She doesn‚Äôt like me for a reason I still can‚Äôt figure out, but she holds my ticket out of this town. ‚ÄúI want the client in Rio.‚Äù\\n\\nHer perfectly shaped brows twitched. It was so small I barely missed it. The coffee machine beeped. Each second, as she filled two cups of coffee, dragged slowly.\\n\\nShe offered me a cup, taking the chair across from mine. She sipped her coffee slowly, peering at me over her cup. ‚ÄúConvince me to give it to you.‚Äù\\n\\nOn the way here, I had already perfected the story I would give her, but I didn‚Äôt think lying to Georgia would get me anywhere, so I told her the truth.\\n\\n‚ÄúI know you hate me, but I really need to get away from here,‚Äù I added when she kept silent. I‚Äôd like to give myself a pat on the shoulder to not cry in front of my boss.\\n\\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ‚Äòhate‚Äô you,‚Äù she said, her voice gentle and careful.\\n\\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like me,‚Äù I pressed.\\n\\n‚ÄúYes, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù she chuckled, tucking her fiery red hair behind her ears.\\n\\nI let out a breath, ready to make my case, but she surprised me again by saying, ‚Äúyou got the job.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I asked, bewildered. ‚ÄúUhm, thank you.‚Äù I kept my composure when deep inside, I was celelarkering this small victory.\\n\\nGeorgia nodded, sipping her coffee.\\n\\n‚ÄúOne question,‚Äù I said, hoping this won‚Äôt affect her decision. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúBecause I see myself in you, Sofia.‚Äù\\n\\n~~\\n\\nI had never been a light traveler. Packing my necessities in two hours was a record-breaking success in my lifetime.\\n\\nThroughout the drive to the airport, Georgia‚Äôs words played like a song out of tune in my head. I didn‚Äôt press on what she meant by it. She volunteered to cover for me in the office and why the sudden change of plans. I didn‚Äôt ask why she was so willing to help me. She had her reasons, and I had mine. As long as I get to get away from here, I don‚Äôt mind what hidden agenda Georgia has.\\n\\nThe sun was already up when I reached the airport. Georgia promised our company driver, Efraim, would meet me there with my plane ticket and client files. I have no idea how she‚Äôll get me a flight on short notice, but I have to trust her.\\n\\nWith his bald head and beer belly, Efraim wasn‚Äôt hard to spot in the crowd, even though he was three inches shorter than me. Holding a manila envelope in one hand, he waved and offered a huge grin.\\n\\n‚ÄúMs. G said you‚Äôre leaving?‚Äù he asked, ptootshieing the envelope.\\n\\n‚ÄúFor business,‚Äù I said, avoiding a longer conversation with Efraim. ‚ÄúGeorgia got me a flight?‚Äù I asked, looking for a plane ticket inside the envelope, brows furrowing when I found none.\\n\\n‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Efraim answered, chuckling.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù panic rose from the pit of my belly.\\n\\nI don‚Äôt expect Kyle to come after me, but I‚Äôd like to avoid any confrontation with him if I could. If he changed his mind, he had the resources to know where to find me.\\n\\n‚ÄúShe got you a private jet.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I repeated my question in a whisper.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nBewildered, I sat on the flush gray leather seat, taking in the palatial interior of Mr. Montiero‚Äôs private jet. In front of me was a gltootshie table and another set of 2 chairs. Wedge on the other side of the plane was a comfy-looking long couch. It appears to be softer than the bed I sleep in every night.\\n\\n‚ÄúMiss Collins, would you like tea, coffee, water?‚Äù a very attractive, groomed, blond young woman, smiled pleasantly. She wore the sharpest charcoal suit jacket and white shirt I had ever seen.\\n\\n‚ÄúA gltootshie of water, thank you,‚Äù I said, suddenly feeling thirsty.\\n\\nShe looked thoughtful for a while, taking my appearance in. Thinking I‚Äôd be flying on an economy flight, I dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. I‚Äôm beginning to wish I didn‚Äôt wear my sneakers and put a little makeup on my puffy cheeks and eyes.\\n\\n‚ÄúMay I also offer you breakfast, Miss Collins? It is a long flight to Rio,‚Äù she said, a gentle smile on her lips.\\n\\nI considered her offer, glancing at the couch behind her. Eyes taking in the stunning white, gray, and black accentuated interior of the jet and the clear blue sky through the window as we flew above the clouds, I lowered my voice and asked, ‚Äúwould it be okay if I sleep on that couch?‚Äù\\n\\nShe glanced at the couch and back at me. ‚ÄúThe cabin is much more comfortable for a rest,‚Äù she said.\\n\\nMy eyes probably lit up like a New Year‚Äôs Eve at her words.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nI was rejuvenated when we landed in Rio. The private jet had its own bathroom, complete with a shower and tub, which I wish to enjoy if there was a repeat of this experience.\\n\\nA car was already waiting for me on the tarmac.\\n\\n‚ÄòJust how rich is this client?‚Äô I haven‚Äôt opened the files since Efraim handed it to me. I don‚Äôt even know what job they‚Äôd require me to do.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhere to Miss?‚Äù The driver in a black and white suit surprised me.\\n\\n‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I asked, meeting his eyes through the rearview mirror.\\n\\nHis brown eyes watched me carefully before he said, ‚Äúto the office or the penthouse.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúPenthouse?‚Äù I parroted, baffled.\\n\\n‚ÄúUh, yes?‚Äù he tilted his head to the side. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be staying at one of Mr. Montiero‚Äôs penthouses.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äúdang,‚Äù I murmured, catching myself too late.\\n\\nThe driver chuckled, his eyes crinkling on the side. ‚ÄúI gathered you haven‚Äôt read his file yet?‚Äù\\n\\nI only noticed then that he had a perfect American accent even though he had those sexy, deep Brazilian eyes and sharp jaws. His dark curly hair was neatly brushed back, yet a few strands mischievously fell on his forehead.\\n\\nCheeks reddening, I shook my head.\\n\\nThrowing an arm on the back of the ptootshieenger seat, he faced me. His smile was bedazzling.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet me give you a brief background about the boss. The ones before you didn‚Äôt even last a week. They studied his behavior for months, pitched big plans, and promised the board they could change his image.‚Äù He chuckled, turning to start the car.

Ben reads out a message from a listener about how the failure to support every child has left class sizes too big, teachers overworked and kids missing out on the support they need.\\n\\n2. #Inflation is coming down.  The spokesperson from the bosses pamphlet on Insiders continued to recite the neo-liberal mantras of higher rates, more unemployment and lower wages but Ben outlines how Jim Chalmers and Labor are implementing a neo-Keynesian approach that is bringing down prices, keeping people in work and supporting those most in need.\\n\\n3.  Workplace reforms are coming to parliament to stop the multi-billion dollar loopholes that see labour hire workers paid less, forced casualisation of millions of people and profiteering at working people's expense.  There's a union for every worker, casual, labour hire, teacher, miner, nurse, graphic designer and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow\\n\\n4. The Housing Affordability Future Fund is coming back.  With $1,300,000 a day NOT going into housing because of the Greens back Dutton's Noalition Labor is ready to set up a double dissolution trigger.\\n\\n5. The Voice.  Greg Sheridan can go on #Insiders to say that Dutton isn't racists if the referendum fails but if all the racists are voting NO does it matter if he considers himself to be racist?  Ben argues you pick a side.  No has Pauline Hanson and Andrew Bolt.  Yes has Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson.\\n\\nWhich side are you on?\\n\\nPlus Ben touches on why the noise around the Rockingham by-election is meaningless Liberal narrative and why Dutton's abysmal record on government contracts is best left to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to determine.\\n#auspol #voteyes #yes #referendum #educationmatters #casual\"}, {'Label': 0, 'text': 'Latest #podcast https://apple.co/44NHZK6\\nVan Badham and Ben Davison congratulate the aged care workers who, by standing together in union, are starting to see their pay increases flow from this week and discuss how there is a union for everyone whether you\\'re in aged care, ice cream making, acting or professional sport.
