Ben reads out a message from a listener about how the failure to support every child has left class sizes too big, teachers overworked and kids missing out on the support they need.\\n\\n2. #Inflation is coming down.  The spokesperson from the bosses pamphlet on Insiders continued to recite the neo-liberal mantras of higher rates, more unemployment and lower wages but Ben outlines how Jim Chalmers and Labor are implementing a neo-Keynesian approach that is bringing down prices, keeping people in work and supporting those most in need.\\n\\n3.  Workplace reforms are coming to parliament to stop the multi-billion dollar loopholes that see labour hire workers paid less, forced casualisation of millions of people and profiteering at working people's expense.  There's a union for every worker, casual, labour hire, teacher, miner, nurse, graphic designer and you can join at australianunions.org.au/wow\\n\\n4. The Housing Affordability Future Fund is coming back.  With $1,300,000 a day NOT going into housing because of the Greens back Dutton's Noalition Labor is ready to set up a double dissolution trigger.\\n\\n5. The Voice.  Greg Sheridan can go on #Insiders to say that Dutton isn't racists if the referendum fails but if all the racists are voting NO does it matter if he considers himself to be racist?  Ben argues you pick a side.  No has Pauline Hanson and Andrew Bolt.  Yes has Marcia Langton and Noel Pearson.\\n\\nWhich side are you on?\\n\\nPlus Ben touches on why the noise around the Rockingham by-election is meaningless Liberal narrative and why Dutton's abysmal record on government contracts is best left to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to determine.\\n#auspol #voteyes #yes #referendum #educationmatters #casual\"}, {'label': 1, 'text': 'Yes campaigners have argued that the Voice will be a “change to the structure of Australia’s public institutions and would redistribute public power via the Constitution”.

And how?\" He asked, taking her picture. \\n\"They found her shopping. But, boss...your ex-wife had triplets in her arms...\" \\n--------------------------------------------------\\n“Why?” Iris asked, shaking her head in question at her husband as she tried to understand why he was angry with her this time. \\nHer husband was packing his things, wanting to leave the house without giving her a proper explanation of what was going on. The two of them did not even argue; therefore, she did not understand what his issue was this time.\\n“Dean, please don’t do this.” She begged, trying to take his hand. Her husband was quick to pull his hand away, glaring at her.\\n“I never did love you, and I never will. You and I both know that our marriage was over long before it even started.” He said, reminding her that their marriage was an arranged one. She had hoped that he would love her by time, she prayed, she fought, she stood strong, tried to lure him in toward her, but nothing worked. The man was as cold as ice when it came to her, and that was something that she failed to realize.\\nShe put her hand on her stomach as she felt it bloat. The last thing she wanted was to lose another pregnancy. This time, Dean didn’t even know about it, she didn’t want to give him any hope like she used to only to end up losing him again if she lost another one of his children.\\nShe knew that Dean wouldn’t touch her if sober and has only slept with her because he was drunk.\\nShe could still remember the night very well. Her husband, the man that she was deeply in love with, had moaned out his mistress’s name in her ear as he imagined her before coming undone. She could still remember the pain and humiliation that she felt, but she never spoke about it to him. \\nThe next morning, when both woke up, the man didn’t bother looking at her. He didn’t even acknowledge the fact that she was in bed.\\n“Dean, the two of us have tried. I have tried, for years, I have tried to satisfy you. But…”\\n“Then stop.” He said, stopping her. She looked down at her feet, avoiding his eyes as tears formed in her eyes. She gripped her shirt as she felt weak. The fact that she knew what had to be done was something that she hated. The man has been insisting on them filing a divorce for months now, and he has been wanting it to end in one sitting. The one way to do so was for both of them to agree on this divorce, making it a ‘mutual’ one, and though it killed her inside, she knew that it had to be done. There was no use to fighting for a relationship that was done.\\nThe man didn’t even want her, and that was something that she knew.\\nShe looked up at the man before wiping her tears, her mind set on the one target that she had in mind. She wanted to keep her child, and she was determined on building her own family. The man may have broken her, he has done it more times than any man has ever done before, and the last thing she wanted was to deal with more of this pain.\\nThankfully, she knew that she had the support of her father, but that didn’t mean that things were going to be easy. If anything, they were not. Her mother was not going to like the fact that she had agreed to a divorce. The woman believed that every marriage had its conflicts, and that everything had a solution.\\nBut Iris knew it for fact, this marriage was over, and whether or not her mother liked it; she was not going to proceed with it. If she was to raise her child in a sane environment, then she had to ensure that she created it for the baby first, and therefore, choosing to leave was going to be the best option.\\nShe was to raise her baby as far away as she could from all these dark memories, and one day, if her child chose to want to see their father, she would be more than welcoming to allow the idea. The man didn’t even care that he had broken her heart as he turned to his things, fixing them in his suitcase. She knew that he was going to that woman, his mistress, the woman who has somehow managed to earn his heart. Ariana.\\n“You wanted to file for a divorce?” She asked, making Dean frown in confusion. He stopped packing his things, and turned to face her, clearly surprised with what she was asking.\\nHis chest ached for a second, and he felt like his breath got caught in his throat. The man nodded, crossing his arms over his chest as he waited to hear what she had to say. She put her hand on her chest, ignoring the pain that she was feeling in the pit of her stomach and her chest. She had to stand strong to fend for her baby. A heartbreak was not going to do her any good, and the constant arguing was only going to end up breaking her.\\n“I remember that you had copies of the papers before? You wanted me to sign them.” She said, keeping her eyes on his, ignoring all the pain that she felt at that very moment as her heart begged her not to do this. She knew that she had to, for her baby, heart, and sanity, she had to do this. Dean studied her expression, unsure of what to say before he nodded.\\n“Yes.” He said, regretting it almost instantly. He knew that she was well aware that he had them. There was no use lying about it now.\\n“I will sign them and get out of your life, Dean Andino.”  She said, looking him dead in the eye, “so, please, do give them to me. Let us end this marriage mutually…”\\n......5 years later......\\nIris:\\n“Lilian, that is enough.” I said, scolding my daughter who was trying to be stubborn. A habit that she seems to have developed since we came here.\\nShe has been refusing to allow me to put on her shirt for the past half an hour and has been trying to escape me since. I hated admitting it, but she was as stubborn as her father was.\\n“But, mama, I don’t like this shirt.” She said, pouting her lips. \\nI sighed and put the shirt down before taking her hands in mine, pulling her to my chest. It was something that I always did when she was having a fit. Trying to understand her often helped, though sometimes I even failed to do that. I still tried my best.\\n“You didn’t like this shirt, nor did you like the other twenty shirts that I pulled out.” I said, teasing her. She giggled and shook her head at me before putting her hand in her mouth. \\nI was thankful for her being in my life, she was a blessing to me that made all the struggles that I have been through with my ex worthwhile. At least I knew that my little princess wasn’t in a toxic place where the two of us were constantly fighting, and I knew that she was somewhat happy in the life that she was living. \\n“Is there anything that is bothering you, my little princess?”\\n“I don’t want to go to school.” She said, and I smiled. It was her first day at preschool, and she has been giving me a hard time since last night. \\nAt least now I understand why. The fact that she didn’t want to go anywhere where kids were with both their parents was something that I was somewhat used to, and though it did sometimes hurt me to know that I didn’t do enough to fulfill my role as the mother and father figures in her life, I couldn’t blame her. \\n“Can you tell me why you don’t want to go to school? Are you afraid of not fitting in?” I asked, trying to be as gentle as I could be with her. \\nBut she had the same attitude on her third day at her daycare, and when I asked what happened, it was her teacher who explained to me that she felt different when she realized that most of the kids had both their parents with them, and that she only came with me. It killed me inside that I had to separate her from her father, but I knew since that day that things wouldn’t have been the same.\\n“Why do other kids have a daddy and I don’t?” She asked, making my chest ache. \\nHow could I explain to a four year old that her father never bothered giving me a chance to begin with? I tried to shower her with the love that any daughter could get, but I wasn’t her father, and I knew that no matter how hard I would try to be, I was never going to be. \\n“You do have a daddy, sweetheart, and one day, very close, I will be sure that the two of you reunite again. For now, I just need you to be a little patient.” I said, my voice softening as I ran my hand over her cheek.\\nAs much as I hated what happened between us, I never did try to make her hate her father. In her eyes, he was the hero that she wanted to meet. I just didn’t know how that was going to be possible right now.\\nThe two of us have been living in Orlando since she was born, and my parents would visit every once and a while, but now, considering that it has been almost five years since I left; therefore, I believed that it was time to go back. I had my businesses to tend to, and with my father growing ill by the day, I knew that I had to start taking care of them. It was one of the reasons why I was going back to begin with. The one issue that I had was knowing that Dean was a main partner. Just the idea of having to see him in a meeting or gathering was something that I feared, but I knew that it was about time to face him. I couldn’t keep running away from him for life, right?\\nLilian kept her eyes on mine, studying my expression for a few seconds before she nodded. She often knew when she was giving me a hard time and when she wasn’t, and she knew that she was. She looked at her shirts for a few seconds before pulling the pink one that I wanted to put on her. Thankfully, she had a white bateau on, otherwise, I would have worried about her growing sick. Especially considering the fact that it was November.\\n“Do you want to choose your coat? Or are you going to be giving mommy a hard time again?” I asked, teasing my daughter who giggled, clearly amused by what she did. \\nShe knew that she mostly didn’t get in trouble. In truth, I rarely ever thought of punishing her. In my head, she was my little princess, and I was there to spoil her. The last thing that I wanted was for her to be scared of me or to want to be away from me.\\nIf anything, I had taught her at a young age to come and tell me everything. I would be there by her side, backing her up, even if I had to scold her sometimes if I knew that she did something bad. But the last thing I wanted was for her and I to have the same relationship that I had with my mother.\\nIt was one that was almost nonexistent, and I knew that it was one of the reasons why Dean and I never worked out.\\nThe man didn’t respect me as he saw that my family didn’t. The man saw me as weak and unwanted, and though our marriage was initially arranged, the two of us could have managed to work a few things out, I believed it. But things somehow backfired on me when he heard a conversation between my mother and I, and somewhere deep inside me, I knew that we would never be able to be one.\\nThe gap had been created that night, and it was all because of that argument. It was an argument that sent him off to finding his peace elsewhere, and that is something that I can never forget. It is something that I personally would have never wanted; however, he chose not to listen, and she chose to pressure me. Both sides ended up breaking me badly, but nevertheless, I knew that it might have happened for a reason, and I hoped that it was a good one.\\n“I want the white one, please. The one with the yellow smiley face.” She said, and I smiled and nodded. I took her hand in mine and gently kissed her palm.\\n“Right away, my little princes.”\\n............\\nDean:\\n“You seem distracted, my love.” My wife, Mariana, said, breaking my train of thoughts.\\nThe amount of work that I had was overwhelming, and despite her knowing about it, she didn’t seem to really care. If anything, all she cared about was what she gained and what she was going to benefit, something that I found both selfish and annoying, but now was not the time to argue about it.\\nI looked at her over my shoulder, choosing not to want to respond. I had to work to tend to and the last thing I needed was for her and I to be arguing. And considering the fact that I knew that our conversation was going to end up turning into an argument to begin with, spoke a lot about how our marriage has been going over the past few years.\\nIt has been five years since our marriage, and in this marriage, I came to believe that the two of us were indeed not fit for one another. \\nThe anger that I felt toward myself for letting go of a person who I knew was perfect for me was something that I could not deny; however, it was also something that I could not admit. I made my choice despite being warned and given the option not to go through with it, it was me who fought all the odds to simply be with a woman who saw me as nothing but a bank account for her to use.\\nIt said more than a little that the two of us, despite being married for a long while and being together before it, didn’t bother starting a family. She did open up about it once, wanting to stabilize herself with me as a wife when everyone turned their backs on her or ended up showing her that she didn’t fit. However, I had to admit, it was me who resented it and didn’t want it with her.\\n“Dean, you have been off for months now and this is really getting out of hand.” Mariana said, breaking my train of thoughts. \\nI took a deep breath, controlling my anger before turning around to face her. There was no point in upsetting her now, the woman that I wanted to get back to, my flower, was nowhere to be seen. I have fought for years to find her, but I wasn’t stupid, she was not in the city and did not want to be found; I would have found a trace of her otherwise.\\nHer father and I still worked together, and though I knew that he was disappointed and angry with me for breaking his daughter’s heart, the man chose to keep a professional distance between us. The man and I didn’t bring up the old issues, nor did he lash out on me once; however, he didn’t allow me to say his daughter’s name. It was something that I couldn’t blame him for. The woman did fight for me, it wasn’t something that I could deny. It was me who chose to resent and kick her out. It wasn’t her fault at all.\\n“I have a lot to deal with, Mariana.” I said, cupping her cheeks, gently running my finger over them. \\nI knew that she would end up causing an issue, and could even come to the company with that issue, and that was not something that I wanted. I didn’t need to see her in the building today, I knew that I would end up acting badly and that wasn’t something that I didn’t want. \\n“You know the stress of work tends to get to me at times, and with the number of things that I have to deal with right now, I really need a break. Please don’t ask me too many questions that I don’t want to answer. I know that you want to help but, Mariana, my love, I need to be able to solve them on my own.”\\n“I am here to support you, my love, but if you don’t open up to me to allow me to do so…”\\n“Mariana, the two of us are already aware that the two of us have our own worlds. And I for one do not like sharing my world of work nor do I like mixing it with my house.” I said, stopping her. \\nThe fact that she was initially my secretary meant many rumors had spread when I got a divorce and married her a month later. It was something that cost me a lot when it came to employees who have been fired for not respecting her, and to investors who chose to withdraw their stocks as they feared losing them considering that Iris’s father is my partner. \\nThankfully, the man was kind enough not to ruin my business for me as he kept going with the partnership, and though he didn’t mention it, I knew that it was Iris who might have spoken to him about it.\\nSome, if not most, said that she was the reason behind our divorce. Iris never answered them, and that came as a surprise. The woman simply claimed that it was a mutual divorce agreement, and though that wasn’t the case, she chose not to ruin my name.\\nIt was something that I knew that Mariana wouldn’t do. Mariana would do her best to ruin me, my reputation, and family. But Iris proved to me that she wouldn’t harm me if it cost her everything, and I knew that our divorce has cost her a lot. If anything, it initially cost her the pain that she has put me through. It was something that I hated about myself, but I never tried changing it.\\n“It seems to me like you forgot that I was initially your secretary. If anyone would know how your work goes, Dean, it is me.” She said, crossing her arms over her chest. \\nI rolled my eyes and walked to the bathroom, ignoring her attitude. The last thing I needed was to argue with her right now. It was bad enough that she was starting to ask me about the two of us conceiving. At first, it was me who wanted this. I wanted the two of us to build a family and I wanted to have an heir.\\nBut the closer we get together, the more I resent the idea of building a family. And I couldn’t understand the reason behind it. Maybe my attraction toward her was just the fact that it was forbidden. But when we made it real, things just went crazy. The two of us just lost the fling between us, and that was not something that I could easily admit.\\n“That was in the past, Mariana. It is something that the two of us know.” I said, not bothering to look at her. I could tell that she was shaking her head at me behind me, but that was not something I cared about. I had work to tend to, and that was something that I knew; therefore, this marriage drama was not one that I was looking into.\\nI frowned as my phone rang, and I raised an eyebrow at the fact that it was my secretary. The woman never dared to call me when I was at home. It was due to Mariana scaring her not to do so. The threats that the woman got prevented her from thinking of looking at me rather than speaking to me.\\nIf anything, the woman didn’t dare speak to me unless it was strictly work behavior, and I couldn’t blame Mariana for it. The woman was afraid that she would repeat the same past that she made Iris live through and that was something that I knew very well. It was something that I chose to excuse her for and for that, I walked out of the bedroom to take the call.\\n“Tell me, Sienna?” I asked, not bothering to greet the woman. I never did greet her anyway, so she wasn’t surprised by my response.\\n“Boss, the men found her.” She said, and I frowned in confusion. \\nHer next words took me off guard, making my heart drop to the stomach before I felt my breath getting caught in my throat. “They found your ex, Ms. Iris…”\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!😭😭\\nInstall the APP to search for the title\\n\"A Baby for The CEO.”❣️❣️❣️ 🔞Click to Read more about📜A Baby for The CEO.📜 www.novel-oasis.com'}, {'label': 1, 'text': 'Is it purely advisory or will it have decision making capabilities? #yes23 #TheVoice michelleforhiggins.com.au'}, {'label': 1, 'text': 'Is it purely advisory or will it have decision making capabilities? #yes23 #TheVoice www.instagram.com'}, {'label': 0, 'text': \"Get ready to laugh and nod in agreement, ladies!

He was sporting a suit three shades darker than his eyes, a white shirt underneath unbuttoned at the very top. His blond locks were combed back to perfection, framing his face.\\n\\nI lift a shoulder in a shrug, my knife cutting through the grilled Branzino on my plate. “You know Katerina Simone?” I asked, and brought my fork to my mouth. I moaned at the unbelievable taste of piquant basil, ginger, and lime. When I opened my eyes, Kyle was observing me, eyes dilated with an emotion I could not point out. “What?” I wiped my mouth with the napkin.\\n\\nAdam’s apple bobbing up and down, he reached for his wine.\\n\\n“Stop moaning like that,” he said, lips hovering over his gltootshie.\\n\\nI bit my lip, cheeks warming up.\\n\\nKyle and I had been together for two years and engaged for one, yet he never failed to make me blush.\\n\\nTucking my hair behind my ears, I reached for my own drink. His heated gaze made my mouth dry. He stared at me as though he couldn’t wait to strip this little black dress I’m wearing.\\n\\nHoping to get my mind back on track, I took in the fancy accent and framed artwork lining the wall. We are in one of the swankiest restaurants in Boston. Words go around that reservations here could take about a month or two, yet I doubt Kyle waited that long. Being one of Boston’s most sought out defense lawyers, Kyle was used to dining in places like this.\\n\\n“Katerina, Fernando Simone’s daughter?” he asked.\\n\\nDark midnight eyes held my gaze, a promise that this night would end better than the lemon pie for our dessert. I was so distracted by the way he was looking at me I’d forgotten what we were talking about.\\n\\n“She walked into the office and specifically looked for me. She said,” I made a quotation in the air, “‘Gia told me you are the best in this field. I need you to work for me.’ It was really weird since Gia Marquez, and I didn’t see eye to eye when I was working with her.”\\n\\n“Interesting,” Kyle murmured, brows tilting to the ceiling.\\n\\nI hummed a yes.\\n\\nFor the last four years, I crawled up the ladder of Lewis Brown Public Relations from Intern to Account Coordinator and got promoted to Account Executive two years ago. On record, Gia Marquez is the most challenging client our team has ever handled. It’s funny how she could say a good word about me when she cursed me and my roots when I worked with her. She was a total larker, coming from old money, just like Katerina.\\n\\nShaking my head at the memory, I set down my gltootshie with a sigh.\\n\\n“You accepted her,” Kyle commented. It’s one thing I love about Kyle. He can read me like the back of his hand. A crease in my brows, a sigh, a pout. I don’t know how he does that, but he just gets me.\\n\\n“What can I do?” I traced the mouth of my gltootshie with my fingers, shoulders slouching. “Georgia gave me two choices: accept Katerina or take this billionaire client in Rio.”\\n\\nGeorgia, my senior account executive, candidly dislikes me for unknown reasons.\\n\\nKyle reached across the table, taking my hand. He stroked my knuckles with his thumb. “You made it this far, and this is your dream job. Don’t let Georgia stop you from reaching your goal.” Our eyes locked, and his sincerity caressed my heart the way his thumb did to my knuckles. “I know a good way to help you relax,” he smirked.\\n\\nLike an obedient puppy, my mind instantly shoved away what worries it was constructing. I gripped Kyle’s hand, tilting it up, my fingertips tracing his palm lines. Pressing both elbows on the table, I lowered my voice and asked, “oh yeah?”\\n\\nHe huffed, setting down his empty gltootshie and catching my wandering fingers. “Sounds like you are challenging me, Baby Girl.”\\n\\nOh, he’s in the mood.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nKyle shaved a good five minutes off from what typically takes a thirty minute drive from the city to his upstate mansion. After parking unceremoniously at the roundabout, Kyle slid out, opened the door for me, and basically plucked me from my seat. He trapped me against the door after shutting it with a thud, plowing his fingers through my hair, smashing our lips together. His soft lips tasted of wine with a pinch of lemon pie.\\n\\n“You will be sick tomorrow,” he said, biting my lower lip, his hard-on pressing on my hip bone.\\n\\nMind fogged with lust, I pulled away to confirm if I had heard him correctly. “Are you a mind reader now, Atty. Andrews?”\\n\\nHe gripped my jaw. “I’ll screwing ruin you tonight, Sofia,” he stated, eyes skimming down my body. “You know I go crazy seeing your legs like this, yet you chose this sinfully short dress on a workday date night.”\\n\\nI swallowed hard. Empty promises were not Kyle’s forte. Georgia would kill me if I called in sick on a Wednesday, especially after taking on an important client like Katerina.\\n\\n“It’s what I had in mind when I chose this.” I clutched the lapel of his suit.\\n\\nKyle groaned, gripping my hand. In a handful of steps, we are inside his mansion. Kyle yanked me to face him, grabbed my jaw, and smashed our lips together. He groaned impatiently as I parted my lips, letting him deepen the kiss. He kept steering us through the house until my butt bumped into a hard edge.\\n\\nWith the help of the warm corner lights, I realized he had brought us to the kitchen, my back resting on the edge of the kitchen island.\\n\\n“Tell me you’re mine.” He kissed his way down my throat, palming my bare with one hand, the other reaching for the side zipper of my dress.\\n\\n“I’m yours, all yours,” I said, gasping as the cool wind blasted my skin, following the ripping sound of my dress.\\n\\nKyle’s demonstration of strength stirred my excitement to a new height. He spun me around with an impatient growl, skipping all foreplay. He ripped my black thongs, the ruined fabric joining my dress around my feet. The fumbling of his belt was music to my ears. Warm hands trailed down my spine, guiding me to bend over the island.\\n\\nAnd there, Kyle proved he was a man of his word; the ruining comment might have been an understatement. He marked me, owned me just like every time we were together.\\n\\nThrough the desire overdose, we reached his bedroom and slept in each other’s arms, spent yet satisfied.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night, I woke up with a dire need to pee. When I went back to bed, the continuous blinking of Kyle’s phone on the nightstand grabbed my attention.\\n\\nThinking it was an emergency, I neared the bed to wake him up. My body froze when I saw the notification on his locked screen.\\n\\n‘I warned you, Kyle.’\\n\\n‘I’ll tell her myself if you can’t.’\\n\\nCuriosity getting the best of me, I unlocked his phone with my birthday; what I read ruined me, indeed.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\n‘I’m pregnant.’\\n\\n‘Are you sure it’s mine?’\\n\\n‘Are you calling me a liar? Babies happen when you have sex, Kyle. And we did more than just have sex. We screwed!’\\n\\n‘You sound so sure I am the father. I don’t remember a screwing thing about that night!’ I gathered through my blurry sight. It was Kyle’s response to the image of a pregnancy test result.\\n\\nIt’s ironic how parallel lines could light up the future I had built with Kyle in flames and turn it to ash.\\n\\nI couldn’t breathe. There seemed to be an oxygen shortage inside the room. My chest caved as questions filled my head. ‘What the heck is happening? Kyle? My Kyle. My fiance got another woman pregnant?’\\n\\nReaching the end of the thread that started more than a month ago, I finally had the guts to look at the display profile on the chat.\\n\\nA strangled sob escaped my lips. I covered my mouth, my hand touching my wet cheeks.\\n\\nIt was Katerina Simone.\\n\\nMy fiance was the father of her child. Behind closed doors, she told Georgia and me what kind of service she’d require from us.\\n\\n‘I am pregnant,’ Katerina said. ‘And I don’t want the public to know about my pregnancy until after my wedding.’\\n\\nAt LBPR, we live for these kinds of stories. You’d be surprised at the cost people would pay to maintain their perfect image.\\n\\n‘Their names are worth more than their fortune,’ that’s what Chairman Lewis used to say.\\n\\nIn this case, Katerina has more than an image to protect. She chose me with intent. It’s not because of my excellent work at keeping Gia Marquez’s secret relationship with a governor. By coming to me, she made a statement to Kyle.\\n\\n“Babe,” Kyle’s sleep-laced voice snapped me out of my trance.\\n\\nI lifted my gaze to him, not even bothering to wipe my tears.\\n\\nHe opened the bedside lamp, rubbing the sleep off his eyes. It took him about five seconds to take in my appearance.\\n\\n“Why are you crying?” His eyes landed on my hand, clutching his phone. “What’s going on?”\\n\\n“What’s going on with you and Katerina?” I’d like to give myself a pat on the back for not stuttering.\\n\\nA tag of war was happening inside my head. One part believed that he would never do this to me. And the other tells me to wake the screw up; the evidence was ready to bite me in the face.\\n\\nHe sat on the edge of the bed and took his phone, brows creasing as he scanned what was on display.\\n\\nI clenched my fist. The sadness in my chest was slowly morphing into anger. A black hole was quickly sucking the future I dreamt of building with him. The kids, the waking up together and coming home to each other every night… This was the man I was supposed to marry.\\n\\n‘How did this happen to us?’\\n\\nHe was my end game, or so I thought.\\n\\nHe placed his phone on the nightstand, stretched to his full height, and reached for me. “It’s not what it seems.”\\n\\nI snorted, wiggling my hand from his grip, but it was to no avail. He hooked a finger beneath my chin, forcing me to look up at him. The reticent light in his room revealed his pleading blue eyes. “Baby, let me explain.”\\n\\n“Explain what? Everything I needed to know was in that conversation.” My entire body was trembling. A tsunami of emotions spiraled down my spine. “You woke up next to her, bare… in your childhood bedroom. She’s two months pregnant, and you kept all of this from me!”\\n\\n“Baby, I don’t remember that night. I was screwing wasted,” he said, skimming his hand over his face. The realness of the situation made breathing a struggle. Kyle has always been tootshieertive, and he is anything but a light weight. How could I believe a word he was saying?\\n\\n“Are you sure you didn’t screw her because she sounds so screwing sure, Kyle?” Those words left a bitter taste on my tongue.\\n\\nHis silence was my answer. I took a sharp breath, stepping away from him as though his proximity was suffocating me.\\n\\nKyle exhaled. I hate that he still looked calm and collected while here I am, a crying mess. “Just give me time. I will fix this situation.”\\n\\nI faced him. “How can you fix this situation, Kyle, huh? I bet your mom would be ecstatic to know about Katerina’s pregnancy.”\\n\\nHe lowered his head, blowing a deep breath. “She already knows, doesn’t she?”\\n\\nSince he introduced me to his family, his mom’s animosity towards me was as clear as a cloudless sky. Kyle’s family came from old money. And being the only son of a lawyer and a doctor, his mom wanted him to marry one of her amiga’s daughters. ‘A girl from high society,’ she once blatantly said in my face, not some publicist working nine to five.\\n\\nI wiped my tears. “I bet she’s already planning your wedding with Katerina.”\\n\\nKyle reached for me, but I stepped back. “Sofia... you’re the one I want to marry. Please, don’t do this to us. I will figure something out.”\\n\\n“You’re the one who did this to us! I love you, but this is too much. I need space. I need time to think.”\\n\\nSomething dangerous crossed his face. “If you leave now, I won’t be chasing you.”\\n\\nOf all the things he’d say, that line never crossed my mind.\\n\\n“Mom threatened to disown me if I didn’t marry Katerina. And you leaving me this way...” his long lash gaze pierced my soul when he met my eyes. “I have nothing left to lose.”\\n\\nMy mouth ran dry. How could he reverse the situation as if I were the one ending this relationship? I am not the one who slept with Katerina!\\n\\n“I was ready to give up everything for you... if you leave me now, you will lose me forever.”\\n\\n“Are you seriously giving me an ultimatum?”\\n\\nHe raked his hair roughly. “You don’t know how long I’ve been fighting for this relationship, Sofia. All I am asking is time to fix this, and you can’t even give me that.”\\n\\nConfrontations had always been Kyle’s expertise. He could twist the law in his sleep. He always finds a loophole, and he’s using that to his advantage.\\n\\nMy anger got the best of me. I jutted my chin up, meeting his gaze defiantly. “Well, you don’t have to fight for anything anymore, Kyle.”\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe sun is not up yet. I glanced left to right on the empty street, shifting from one foot to another. This is the last place I’d see myself after breaking my engagement off.\\n\\nDrawing in a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell to Georgia’s place. The silence of this neighborhood was sullen, and her footsteps as she approached the door were like a drum roll to the plot twist of my story.\\n\\n“This better be a life and death-“ her sleep-laced voice halted as she took in my appearance. “What the heck happened to you, Sofia?”\\n\\n“Oh.” I glanced down at Kyle’s shirt and joggers. They swallow my small frame like a blanket. My hair was a tangled mess, no less, and my face was no better. “Can I come in?”\\n\\nWithout missing a beat, she stepped aside and allowed me in.\\n\\nShe led me to the kitchen. I sat on the stool by the breakfast bar while Georgia busied herself on the coffee machine. As the machine purred gently, she faced me and crossed her arms. “You are here for a reason.”\\n\\nI sighed. Georgia is the last person I’d confide in about my problems. We are not friends. She doesn’t like me for a reason I still can’t figure out, but she holds my ticket out of this town. “I want the client in Rio.”\\n\\nHer perfectly shaped brows twitched. It was so small I barely missed it. The coffee machine beeped. Each second, as she filled two cups of coffee, dragged slowly.\\n\\nShe offered me a cup, taking the chair across from mine. She sipped her coffee slowly, peering at me over her cup. “Convince me to give it to you.”\\n\\nOn the way here, I had already perfected the story I would give her, but I didn’t think lying to Georgia would get me anywhere, so I told her the truth.\\n\\n“I know you hate me, but I really need to get away from here,” I added when she kept silent. I’d like to give myself a pat on the shoulder to not cry in front of my boss.\\n\\n“I don’t ‘hate’ you,” she said, her voice gentle and careful.\\n\\n“You don’t like me,” I pressed.\\n\\n“Yes, I don’t,” she chuckled, tucking her fiery red hair behind her ears.\\n\\nI let out a breath, ready to make my case, but she surprised me again by saying, “you got the job.”\\n\\n“Yeah?” I asked, bewildered. “Uhm, thank you.” I kept my composure when deep inside, I was celelarkering this small victory.\\n\\nGeorgia nodded, sipping her coffee.\\n\\n“One question,” I said, hoping this won’t affect her decision. “Why?”\\n\\n“Because I see myself in you, Sofia.”\\n\\n~~\\n\\nI had never been a light traveler. Packing my necessities in two hours was a record-breaking success in my lifetime.\\n\\nThroughout the drive to the airport, Georgia’s words played like a song out of tune in my head. I didn’t press on what she meant by it. She volunteered to cover for me in the office and why the sudden change of plans. I didn’t ask why she was so willing to help me. She had her reasons, and I had mine. As long as I get to get away from here, I don’t mind what hidden agenda Georgia has.\\n\\nThe sun was already up when I reached the airport. Georgia promised our company driver, Efraim, would meet me there with my plane ticket and client files. I have no idea how she’ll get me a flight on short notice, but I have to trust her.\\n\\nWith his bald head and beer belly, Efraim wasn’t hard to spot in the crowd, even though he was three inches shorter than me. Holding a manila envelope in one hand, he waved and offered a huge grin.\\n\\n“Ms. G said you’re leaving?” he asked, ptootshieing the envelope.\\n\\n“For business,” I said, avoiding a longer conversation with Efraim. “Georgia got me a flight?” I asked, looking for a plane ticket inside the envelope, brows furrowing when I found none.\\n\\n“She didn’t,” Efraim answered, chuckling.\\n\\n“What?” panic rose from the pit of my belly.\\n\\nI don’t expect Kyle to come after me, but I’d like to avoid any confrontation with him if I could. If he changed his mind, he had the resources to know where to find me.\\n\\n“She got you a private jet.”\\n\\n“What?” I repeated my question in a whisper.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nBewildered, I sat on the flush gray leather seat, taking in the palatial interior of Mr. Montiero’s private jet. In front of me was a gltootshie table and another set of 2 chairs. Wedge on the other side of the plane was a comfy-looking long couch. It appears to be softer than the bed I sleep in every night.\\n\\n“Miss Collins, would you like tea, coffee, water?” a very attractive, groomed, blond young woman, smiled pleasantly. She wore the sharpest charcoal suit jacket and white shirt I had ever seen.\\n\\n“A gltootshie of water, thank you,” I said, suddenly feeling thirsty.\\n\\nShe looked thoughtful for a while, taking my appearance in. Thinking I’d be flying on an economy flight, I dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. I’m beginning to wish I didn’t wear my sneakers and put a little makeup on my puffy cheeks and eyes.\\n\\n“May I also offer you breakfast, Miss Collins? It is a long flight to Rio,” she said, a gentle smile on her lips.\\n\\nI considered her offer, glancing at the couch behind her. Eyes taking in the stunning white, gray, and black accentuated interior of the jet and the clear blue sky through the window as we flew above the clouds, I lowered my voice and asked, “would it be okay if I sleep on that couch?”\\n\\nShe glanced at the couch and back at me. “The cabin is much more comfortable for a rest,” she said.\\n\\nMy eyes probably lit up like a New Year’s Eve at her words.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nI was rejuvenated when we landed in Rio. The private jet had its own bathroom, complete with a shower and tub, which I wish to enjoy if there was a repeat of this experience.\\n\\nA car was already waiting for me on the tarmac.\\n\\n‘Just how rich is this client?’ I haven’t opened the files since Efraim handed it to me. I don’t even know what job they’d require me to do.\\n\\n“Where to Miss?” The driver in a black and white suit surprised me.\\n\\n“Excuse me?” I asked, meeting his eyes through the rearview mirror.\\n\\nHis brown eyes watched me carefully before he said, “to the office or the penthouse.”\\n\\n“Penthouse?” I parroted, baffled.\\n\\n“Uh, yes?” he tilted his head to the side. “You’d be staying at one of Mr. Montiero’s penthouses.”\\n\\n“dang,” I murmured, catching myself too late.\\n\\nThe driver chuckled, his eyes crinkling on the side. “I gathered you haven’t read his file yet?”\\n\\nI only noticed then that he had a perfect American accent even though he had those sexy, deep Brazilian eyes and sharp jaws. His dark curly hair was neatly brushed back, yet a few strands mischievously fell on his forehead.\\n\\nCheeks reddening, I shook my head.\\n\\nThrowing an arm on the back of the ptootshieenger seat, he faced me. His smile was bedazzling.\\n\\n“Let me give you a brief background about the boss. The ones before you didn’t even last a week. They studied his behavior for months, pitched big plans, and promised the board they could change his image.” He chuckled, turning to start the car. The gentle hum of the engine brought me back to reality.\\n\\nSince he already knew my secret of coming here unprepared, I dared ask. “What image do I need to change, exactly?”\\n\\nThe man chuckled. “See for yourself.”\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"\\n\\nBlurred Lines 1: CHASE”🤩🤩 👉Click to Read more about📜<Blurred Lines 1: CHASE>📜 www.novel-oasis.com'}, {'label': 1, 'text': 'AJA COMES OUT AGAINST THE VOICE ON NATIONAL TV\\n\\nAJA President Dr David Adler appeared on Sky News Outsiders program to call out race-based divisions. \\n\\nDr Adler called out PM Anthony Albanese who has falsely associated the Jewish community with the Voice and sparked a wave of online antisemitism. \\n\"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has “latched on” to a “false concept” saying the Jewish community supports the Voice to Parliament.\\nHe’s spruiking it in meetings and on the media,” he told Sky News host Rowan Dean. “It is not true, but because the Prime Minister jumped into it, we had to have an analysis on it from a Jewish perspective.”\\n\\nDr Adler also called out the shift to the left in many Australian Jewish organisations, \"Certain organisations’ shift to the left has also been “away from Jewish values”. “The reaction we’ve had from the community has been extraordinary,” he told Sky News host James Macpherson. “When you’re on social media, your computer, your phone, you decide what sort of information you want, which organisation you link with. “AJA has become by far the largest in Australia on social media and community engagement.”'}, {'label': 0, 'text': \"Make Voice For Women Who trapped in darkness!💜💙Love Shouldn't Hurt🎗Domestic Violence Awareness👉🏻➡️ https://bit.ly/3D2B1VL Wearing this tee show our support give them courage and hope to overcome this nightmare.

Any thoughts I had about returning to the women at my table were soon forgotten.\\n\"\"Its fine.\"\" I said, taking calculated steps towards her, stalking my prey. She had long, silky black hair, and was about 5\\'6\\'\\', maybe a little less on account of the high heels she had on. She wore a black long-sleeved top and black mini skirt with fishnet stockings and a fake set of cat ears on top of her head. Her makeup matched her outfit, making her look like a black cat.\\n\"\"Split it with me?\"\" She said, batting her eyes at me. Her face turned bright red the moment I took it from her.\\nI took a big gulp then placed the glass on her lips. \"\"Finish it,\"\" I said, licking my lips. She hesitated but obeyed, downing the rest. I could see her eyes studying me, not sure what to make of me. Being an Alpha made me bigger and stronger than most. \\nI stood at a comfortable six foot four, my body well sculpted from years of exercise and a killer metabolism. I had thick brown tousled hair, looking more on the wild side than the professional side most days. Add in a pair of vibrant green eyes and, well, I was a lady killer.\\n\"\"Do you want to...\"\" She started to ask but blushed again and hung her head, avoiding looking at me.\\nI took her chin between my thumb and pointer fingers, tilting it up to face me. \"\"Do I want to what?\"\" I asked, stepping closer to her.\\nShe took a deep, steadying breath. \"\"Wanna get out of here?\"\" She said, her eyes filled with passion.\\n\"\"My place or yours?\"\" I whispered into her ear, my teeth grazing the soft flesh of her neck.\\n\"\"Yours.\"\" She shivered, her hands grabbing onto me for stability.\\n\"\"Let\\'s go.\"\" I winked, and she smiled. I led her slowly to the front entrance, my hand on the small of her back.\\n\"\"Jeff, keys, now\"\" I ordered via mind link. By the time we got to the front, Jeff was waiting for me, keys in hand, his blond hair a wild mess, his shirt untucked and belt unbuckled. I owed him. He tossed me the keys, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. I gave him a curt nod, a smirk on my own face.\\nI led the way to the car, opening the door for my girl to get in. I shut the door behind her before hopping into the driver\\'s seat and heading for my penthouse in the city. I rested my hand on her exposed thigh, sparks erupting underneath my touch. I must be imagining. Maybe I\\'m more drunk than I thought.\\n\"\"I\\'m never like this.\"\" She blurted out.\\n\"\"Like what?\"\" I asked, my eyes fixated on the road.\\n\"\"I don\\'t normally do stuff like this.\"\" She waived her hand around the car.\\n\"\"Sit in a car?\"\" I said sarcastically, deciding to play with my food.\\n\"\"No\"\" She huffed. \"\"Go home with strangers.\"\"\\n\"\"I\\'m Derek.\"\" I lifted my hand from her thigh and held it out for her to shake.\\n\"\"Valerie.\"\" She answered, shaking my hand.\\n\"\"It\\'s nice to meet you.\"\" I smiled.\\n\"\"You also.\"\" She laughed. It was music to my ears.\\n\"\"There, now we aren\\'t strangers.\"\" I said, returning my hand to her thigh.\\nI pulled up to the condominium where my penthouse was located. Putting the car in park, I got out and opened the door for Valerie, helping her step out. I threw my keys to the bellman who stood outside waiting and led Valerie inside.\\n\"\"So what pack are you from?\"\" I asked, escorting her to the elevators.\\n\"\"Pack? I mean I go to Georgia Coastal College if that\\'s what you mean. I\\'m not in a sorority though.\"\" She shrugged, stepping inside the elevator with me.\\n\"\"You\\'re not...?\"\"\\n\"\"Not what?\"\" She asked.\\n\"\"Never mind.\"\" I said, shaking my head.\\nSomething was wrong. I must be crazy or maybe she is. The moon Goddess wouldn\\'t give me, an Alpha King, a human as a mate. I definitely drank too much. I was downing shots like they were candy. My wolf metabolism must be slowing down, or maybe I\\'m just dreaming. The elevators dinged and opened, leading directly to my penthouse. The view was amazing, which Valerie took notice of immediately.\\n\"\"Make yourself at home. I\\'ll be right back.\"\" I said, discarding my jacket onto the back of one of my dining room chairs. That was its primary purpose, after all, being a coat hanger. I made my way into the kitchen, grabbing a fresh bottle of whiskey and two glasses. I met Valerie back in my living room, finding her staring out the window. I opened the bottle and poured us both a glass, which she gladly took and began nursing. \"\"We don\\'t have to do anything if you don\\'t want to.\"\" I said, her body language telling me she was nervous. She kept shifting from one foot to the other and avoided eye contact.\\n\"\"I want to.\"\" She said without hesitating.\\n\"\"You\\'re sure?\"\" I asked again.\\n\"\"MH\"\" she hummed, finishing off her drink in a few big gulps. \"\"Definitely. This is just a bit new for me.\"\" Her cheeks heated up from the drink or embarrassment. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\"\"Well, alright then.\"\" I said, taking her empty glass and setting it down next to mine. I closed the gap between us, placing my hands on her hips. Her hands found my chest and gently clawed down my body. I could feel myself getting lost in her beautiful chocolate brown eyes.\\n\"\"Alright then.\"\" She said, biting her lip and pressing her chest against me ever so slightly.\\nMy lips crashed down onto hers, devouring her. Our limbs tangled together, tearing away at each other\\'s clothes, feeling every inch of one another. \\nWhen the sun started to make its appearance on the horizon, exhaustion finally took over and we fell asleep tangled in the sheets together. Best. Birthday. Ever.\\nValerie POV\\nLast night was the best night of my entire life. I went to the club to hang out with some friends and distract myself from my everyday problems. What I didn\\'t expect was to leave with someone. \\nTo go back to his place and have the best intercourse of my entire life. I felt so connected to Derek, it was strange. I would never sleep with someone on a first date, let alone after a two-minute encounter at a nightclub! But everything about him drew me in. His looks, his voice, his cologne, his touch, especially his touch.\\nI flipped over, staring at the most gorgeous man I had ever laid my eyes on. Now that daylight was peeking through the window and I was no longer tipsy, I was able to get a good look at all of his features. He screamed masculinity, something I was wildly attracted to. \\nHe was breathing deeply, still sound asleep from our late night of intercourse. The sheets fell around his waist, leaving his impeccable torso wide open. I wanted to lick his chiseled body, again. I settled for snuggling into his side. I wonder if he would want my number? \\nMaybe we could meet for coffee or something. I would even be down for another night like last night with this man. My legs were still shaky and my center still throbbing from his repeated intrusion.\\nMy less than pure thoughts were interrupted when something caught my eye. A scar a few inches thick on his side, and another on his shoulder blade. I sat up, taking a closer look. He had many old wounds actually. What did he do to get all of these? \\nMy mind began conjuring up a hundred awful reasons as to why he would have gotten all of these. Gang member? Ex prison? Mercenary? Hit man? I can\\'t deal with this. No baggage for me, thank you very much, no matter how mind-blowing the intercourse was. \\nI was finally getting into a better place in my life and I wasn\\'t going to blow it by pursuing someone with major issues. I quickly snuck out of bed, grabbing my clothing and preparing for the walk of shame. My heart ran the show more than a few times and look where that landed me. \\nTime to let my brain take the lead. I carefully crept out of the room, taking one last lingering look from the doorway before grabbing a cab and heading back home.\\nDerek POV\\nI woke up feeling well rested for the first time in months, no, years. Was I dreaming last night? What happened? I had a mild headache, undoubtedly from the copious amounts of beverage I consumed last night. \\nI remember working late, Jeff coming to the office, going to the nightclub, lots of drinks...a few women...and her. Valerie. She couldn\\'t have possibly been my mate, she was human if I\\'m not mistaken, which I hardly ever am these days.\\n\"\"She was our mate.\"\" Dean chimed in, still feeling well satisfied.\\n\"\"How can you be so sure?\"\"\\n\"\"How are you not sure? She smelled heavenly, sparks erupted wherever we touched, we connected with her and she gave us the best intercourse of our entire life.\"\" He added. Goddess, if I could see him now, he would probably be lounging in bed smoking a cigar with a smug look on his face.\\nI sat up in bed, throwing my feet over the edge, grabbing my phone and checking my messages. I was shocked to see that I had slept in late, it was almost eleven am. I had a mountain of paperwork to get through. Most of my messages were from Jeff, one from my Delta, Matt, about the training schedule, and a missed call from the council. \\nToday was already turning out to be bad. Maybe I should just go back to bed. I stood up and headed to the bathroom, stepping on something on the way. I bent down and picked up a pair of cat ears. My Kittens. Flashbacks from last night flew through my head. Goddess, she was perfect. After rubbing one out in the shower, I made my way over to the office, preparing myself to put out fires.\\n\"\"There you are! How was last night?\"\" Jeff patted me on the back, falling in step with me as I made my way to my office.\\nMy grim expression turned up for a moment at the thought of last night. \"\"It exceeded my expectations.\"\" I smirked.\\n\"\"Way to hit it man!\"\" Jeff said coyly. \"\"Listen, I hate to spoil your morning, but there is something you need to know-\"\"\\n\"\"King Derek, how nice of you to join us.\"\" Councilman Howard said, unamused, standing in my doorway.\\n\"\"Councilman, what an unexpected surprise. What brings you here?\"\"\\n\"\"Don\\'t play dumb boy, you know why we are here.\"\" He said, stepping back inside my office.\\nI followed him in. The rest of the council were spread out in the room, all except my brother-in-law, King Edward, who was an exception. At least until his twins became the reigning kings, which would be in the next few years now. \\nI set my things down on my desk, preparing myself for the scolding I was about to receive.\\n\"\"You haven\\'t chosen a mate,\"\" Councilwoman Leslie announced.\\n\"\"Obviously,\"\" I retorted, not in the mood for games.\\n\"\"You would be wise to change your tone, boy.\"\" Councilman Charles said, raising his voice.\\n\"\"Why must I choose a mate? Am I not a worthy enough king?\"\" I addressed the room.\\n\"\"It will strengthen your already weakened kingdom. We have given you enough time to find your mate or choose another. Time is nearly up. You have one year to pick your Luna and Queen or we will pick for you.\"\" Councilman Howard said, leaving no room for debate. \\nHe, along with the rest of the council, stood and filed out of my office. \"\"One year,\"\" he reiterated, before slamming my office door shut. I only had one year to find my mate? It took some wolves a lifetime!\\n\"\"We have already found our mate,\"\" Dean noted, as if I were stupid.\\n\"\"We were drunk, that wasn\\'t her.\"\"\\n\"\"Keep living in denial then.\"\" He said annoyingly.\\nKnock Knock Knock\\n\"\"Alpha? You wanted to see me?\"\" Trish knocked at my door.\\n\"\"Come in.\"\" I said, my eyes still glued to the paperwork in front of me.\\n\"\"Is everything okay?\"\" She sat down in the chair across from me.\\n\"\"Yes, well no. I need your help. I need an assistant. Someone who can keep track of my schedule and messages and maybe even bring me coffee. Do you think you could hire someone?\"\" I peered up from my papers.\\n\"\"Absolutely!\"\" She breathed a sigh of relief, flipping her blond hair over her shoulder. \"\"Anything else?\"\" She asked.\\n\"\"No, that will be all.\"\" I dismissed her. \\nThe next day\\nI said hello to Liz and a few others on my way to my desk. Jeff stopped me on the way and asked me to look over something at the loading dock. I set my things down and went to help him, but not before my nose caught a familiar scent. No, it couldn\\'t be. Someone must be wearing perfume or something. I dismissed it and continued along to go help Jeff. When I returned to my office, I noticed a set of keys and a phone resting on the once vacant reception desk. Trish must have finally hired someone.\\nMy ears twitched, hearing a lot of rustling coming from the normally quiet kitchen around the corner from my office. I followed the sound, my nose picking up the same familiar scent. It got stronger and stronger the closer I got, I had to use a lot of self-control not to run towards it. Quietly, I peeked into the kitchen and just watched.\\n\"\"Mate! Mate! It\\'s mate!\"\" Dean yelled in my head while running in circles.\\nI knew immediately who she was, Valerie. The best one-night stand of my life, and regrettably, my mate. She was even more beautiful than I had remembered. But Goddess, what was she doing here? She didn\\'t work here...did she?\\n\"\"Valerie?\"\" I said, taking a few steps forward.\\nHer head snapped up and looked over at me. \"\"Derek?! Ouch!\"\" She said, holding her now bleeding hand. \"\"Ugh! I can\\'t even!\"\" She hissed in pain and frustration. My chest hurt for my mate, only further proving the moon goddess had a sick sense of humor towards my life. Of course, my mate would be a human.\\n\"\"She remembered us...\"\" Dean swooned.\\n\"\"I would hope so, she screamed out our name enough times.\"\" I smirked.\\n\"\"Here, let me see.\"\" I said, carefully taking her hand in mine and looking over the damage. She definitely didn\\'t hold back. She could probably use a few stitches in fact. But even with her injury, sparks erupted over my skin when we touched.\\n\"\"What are you doing here?\"\" She asked.\\n\"\"I work here, what are you doing here?\"\" \" 🔥🔥 Click to Read 👉🏻👉🏻 a.whastory.com'}, {'label': 1, 'text': 'This week, the bill enabling a referendum to alter the Constitution and establish a Voice to Parliament passed the Senate.

Because of the need to find a niche in an oversaturated media landscape, many young political and journalism professionals are pushed into selling themselves as a bi resource. I get it. This strategy makes perfect sense if you happen to be bisexual. As the saying goes, write about what you know. The problem is that once you’re established as a voice on such a narrow topic, how do you remain interesting? How many times can a person write an article about biphobia or bi-erasure before readers and publishers demand something new? The competitive marketplace of ideas incentivizes people to embrace increasingly radical positions. That’s how a simple idea like ‘support same-sex marriage’ [d]evolves into the edgier ‘dismantle the entire concept of marriage because it’s a heteronormative construct.’ Despite being one of these ‘professional bis’ myself, I feel compelled to point out that this race to stay relevant is a dangerous game. It is backfiring on the LGBT community by alienating those who would otherwise be our allies.\\n\\n“I stumbled into ‘bi activism’ accidentally via the LA social scene. My wife, Talia, and I moved from Ashland, Oregon to downtown Los Angeles, where she was pursuing her Masters at USC film school. Neither of us had many friends in the city, so we joined a social club called amBi. At the time, amBi was a local meetup group for bi people in the LA area. Talia knew I was bi, but she identified as straight. Fortunately, the club’s website made it clear that you don’t have to be bisexual to join. It clearly stated that ‘partners and allies’ were welcome. We attended a few events, including a Bi Talent Show at the LA LGBT Center. We quickly made a lot of friends, and our lack-of-an-LA-social-life issue was soon behind us.” -@rio_veradonir @ambisocial\\n\\nLINK IN BIO\\n#Bisexual #LGBT #Activist #Writer'}, {'label': 0, 'text': 'I am proud tonight of our Mallee farmers like Glenden Watts, and proud to stand with them in Canberra to make sure they were seen and heard in Question Time and here on TV raising their concerns about being railroaded into wearing a massive $3.2 billion VNI-West transmission line that the experts say is a monumental mistake and clearly Mallee communities oppose.

He was sporting a suit three shades darker than his eyes, a white shirt underneath unbuttoned at the very top. His blond locks were combed back to perfection, framing his face.\\n\\nI lift a shoulder in a shrug, my knife cutting through the grilled Branzino on my plate. “You know Katerina Simone?” I asked, and brought my fork to my mouth. I moaned at the unbelievable taste of piquant basil, ginger, and lime. When I opened my eyes, Kyle was observing me, eyes dilated with an emotion I could not point out. “What?” I wiped my mouth with the napkin.\\n\\nAdam’s apple bobbing up and down, he reached for his wine.\\n\\n“Stop moaning like that,” he said, lips hovering over his gltootshie.\\n\\nI bit my lip, cheeks warming up.\\n\\nKyle and I had been together for two years and engaged for one, yet he never failed to make me blush.\\n\\nTucking my hair behind my ears, I reached for my own drink. His heated gaze made my mouth dry. He stared at me as though he couldn’t wait to strip this little black dress I’m wearing.\\n\\nHoping to get my mind back on track, I took in the fancy accent and framed artwork lining the wall. We are in one of the swankiest restaurants in Boston. Words go around that reservations here could take about a month or two, yet I doubt Kyle waited that long. Being one of Boston’s most sought out defense lawyers, Kyle was used to dining in places like this.\\n\\n“Katerina, Fernando Simone’s daughter?” he asked.\\n\\nDark midnight eyes held my gaze, a promise that this night would end better than the lemon pie for our dessert. I was so distracted by the way he was looking at me I’d forgotten what we were talking about.\\n\\n“She walked into the office and specifically looked for me. She said,” I made a quotation in the air, “‘Gia told me you are the best in this field. I need you to work for me.’ It was really weird since Gia Marquez, and I didn’t see eye to eye when I was working with her.”\\n\\n“Interesting,” Kyle murmured, brows tilting to the ceiling.\\n\\nI hummed a yes.\\n\\nFor the last four years, I crawled up the ladder of Lewis Brown Public Relations from Intern to Account Coordinator and got promoted to Account Executive two years ago. On record, Gia Marquez is the most challenging client our team has ever handled. It’s funny how she could say a good word about me when she cursed me and my roots when I worked with her. She was a total larker, coming from old money, just like Katerina.\\n\\nShaking my head at the memory, I set down my gltootshie with a sigh.\\n\\n“You accepted her,” Kyle commented. It’s one thing I love about Kyle. He can read me like the back of his hand. A crease in my brows, a sigh, a pout. I don’t know how he does that, but he just gets me.\\n\\n“What can I do?” I traced the mouth of my gltootshie with my fingers, shoulders slouching. “Georgia gave me two choices: accept Katerina or take this billionaire client in Rio.”\\n\\nGeorgia, my senior account executive, candidly dislikes me for unknown reasons.\\n\\nKyle reached across the table, taking my hand. He stroked my knuckles with his thumb. “You made it this far, and this is your dream job. Don’t let Georgia stop you from reaching your goal.” Our eyes locked, and his sincerity caressed my heart the way his thumb did to my knuckles. “I know a good way to help you relax,” he smirked.\\n\\nLike an obedient puppy, my mind instantly shoved away what worries it was constructing. I gripped Kyle’s hand, tilting it up, my fingertips tracing his palm lines. Pressing both elbows on the table, I lowered my voice and asked, “oh yeah?”\\n\\nHe huffed, setting down his empty gltootshie and catching my wandering fingers. “Sounds like you are challenging me, Baby Girl.”\\n\\nOh, he’s in the mood.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nKyle shaved a good five minutes off from what typically takes a thirty minute drive from the city to his upstate mansion. After parking unceremoniously at the roundabout, Kyle slid out, opened the door for me, and basically plucked me from my seat. He trapped me against the door after shutting it with a thud, plowing his fingers through my hair, smashing our lips together. His soft lips tasted of wine with a pinch of lemon pie.\\n\\n“You will be sick tomorrow,” he said, biting my lower lip, his hard-on pressing on my hip bone.\\n\\nMind fogged with lust, I pulled away to confirm if I had heard him correctly. “Are you a mind reader now, Atty. Andrews?”\\n\\nHe gripped my jaw. “I’ll screwing ruin you tonight, Sofia,” he stated, eyes skimming down my body. “You know I go crazy seeing your legs like this, yet you chose this sinfully short dress on a workday date night.”\\n\\nI swallowed hard. Empty promises were not Kyle’s forte. Georgia would kill me if I called in sick on a Wednesday, especially after taking on an important client like Katerina.\\n\\n“It’s what I had in mind when I chose this.” I clutched the lapel of his suit.\\n\\nKyle groaned, gripping my hand. In a handful of steps, we are inside his mansion. Kyle yanked me to face him, grabbed my jaw, and smashed our lips together. He groaned impatiently as I parted my lips, letting him deepen the kiss. He kept steering us through the house until my butt bumped into a hard edge.\\n\\nWith the help of the warm corner lights, I realized he had brought us to the kitchen, my back resting on the edge of the kitchen island.\\n\\n“Tell me you’re mine.” He kissed his way down my throat, palming my bare with one hand, the other reaching for the side zipper of my dress.\\n\\n“I’m yours, all yours,” I said, gasping as the cool wind blasted my skin, following the ripping sound of my dress.\\n\\nKyle’s demonstration of strength stirred my excitement to a new height. He spun me around with an impatient growl, skipping all foreplay. He ripped my black thongs, the ruined fabric joining my dress around my feet. The fumbling of his belt was music to my ears. Warm hands trailed down my spine, guiding me to bend over the island.\\n\\nAnd there, Kyle proved he was a man of his word; the ruining comment might have been an understatement. He marked me, owned me just like every time we were together.\\n\\nThrough the desire overdose, we reached his bedroom and slept in each other’s arms, spent yet satisfied.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night, I woke up with a dire need to pee. When I went back to bed, the continuous blinking of Kyle’s phone on the nightstand grabbed my attention.\\n\\nThinking it was an emergency, I neared the bed to wake him up. My body froze when I saw the notification on his locked screen.\\n\\n‘I warned you, Kyle.’\\n\\n‘I’ll tell her myself if you can’t.’\\n\\nCuriosity getting the best of me, I unlocked his phone with my birthday; what I read ruined me, indeed.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\n‘I’m pregnant.’\\n\\n‘Are you sure it’s mine?’\\n\\n‘Are you calling me a liar? Babies happen when you have sex, Kyle. And we did more than just have sex. We screwed!’\\n\\n‘You sound so sure I am the father. I don’t remember a screwing thing about that night!’ I gathered through my blurry sight. It was Kyle’s response to the image of a pregnancy test result.\\n\\nIt’s ironic how parallel lines could light up the future I had built with Kyle in flames and turn it to ash.\\n\\nI couldn’t breathe. There seemed to be an oxygen shortage inside the room. My chest caved as questions filled my head. ‘What the heck is happening? Kyle? My Kyle. My fiance got another woman pregnant?’\\n\\nReaching the end of the thread that started more than a month ago, I finally had the guts to look at the display profile on the chat.\\n\\nA strangled sob escaped my lips. I covered my mouth, my hand touching my wet cheeks.\\n\\nIt was Katerina Simone.\\n\\nMy fiance was the father of her child. Behind closed doors, she told Georgia and me what kind of service she’d require from us.\\n\\n‘I am pregnant,’ Katerina said. ‘And I don’t want the public to know about my pregnancy until after my wedding.’\\n\\nAt LBPR, we live for these kinds of stories. You’d be surprised at the cost people would pay to maintain their perfect image.\\n\\n‘Their names are worth more than their fortune,’ that’s what Chairman Lewis used to say.\\n\\nIn this case, Katerina has more than an image to protect. She chose me with intent. It’s not because of my excellent work at keeping Gia Marquez’s secret relationship with a governor. By coming to me, she made a statement to Kyle.\\n\\n“Babe,” Kyle’s sleep-laced voice snapped me out of my trance.\\n\\nI lifted my gaze to him, not even bothering to wipe my tears.\\n\\nHe opened the bedside lamp, rubbing the sleep off his eyes. It took him about five seconds to take in my appearance.\\n\\n“Why are you crying?” His eyes landed on my hand, clutching his phone. “What’s going on?”\\n\\n“What’s going on with you and Katerina?” I’d like to give myself a pat on the back for not stuttering.\\n\\nA tag of war was happening inside my head. One part believed that he would never do this to me. And the other tells me to wake the screw up; the evidence was ready to bite me in the face.\\n\\nHe sat on the edge of the bed and took his phone, brows creasing as he scanned what was on display.\\n\\nI clenched my fist. The sadness in my chest was slowly morphing into anger. A black hole was quickly sucking the future I dreamt of building with him. The kids, the waking up together and coming home to each other every night… This was the man I was supposed to marry.\\n\\n‘How did this happen to us?’\\n\\nHe was my end game, or so I thought.\\n\\nHe placed his phone on the nightstand, stretched to his full height, and reached for me. “It’s not what it seems.”\\n\\nI snorted, wiggling my hand from his grip, but it was to no avail. He hooked a finger beneath my chin, forcing me to look up at him. The reticent light in his room revealed his pleading blue eyes. “Baby, let me explain.”\\n\\n“Explain what? Everything I needed to know was in that conversation.” My entire body was trembling. A tsunami of emotions spiraled down my spine. “You woke up next to her, bare… in your childhood bedroom. She’s two months pregnant, and you kept all of this from me!”\\n\\n“Baby, I don’t remember that night. I was screwing wasted,” he said, skimming his hand over his face. The realness of the situation made breathing a struggle. Kyle has always been tootshieertive, and he is anything but a light weight. How could I believe a word he was saying?\\n\\n“Are you sure you didn’t screw her because she sounds so screwing sure, Kyle?” Those words left a bitter taste on my tongue.\\n\\nHis silence was my answer. I took a sharp breath, stepping away from him as though his proximity was suffocating me.\\n\\nKyle exhaled. I hate that he still looked calm and collected while here I am, a crying mess. “Just give me time. I will fix this situation.”\\n\\nI faced him. “How can you fix this situation, Kyle, huh? I bet your mom would be ecstatic to know about Katerina’s pregnancy.”\\n\\nHe lowered his head, blowing a deep breath. “She already knows, doesn’t she?”\\n\\nSince he introduced me to his family, his mom’s animosity towards me was as clear as a cloudless sky. Kyle’s family came from old money. And being the only son of a lawyer and a doctor, his mom wanted him to marry one of her amiga’s daughters. ‘A girl from high society,’ she once blatantly said in my face, not some publicist working nine to five.\\n\\nI wiped my tears. “I bet she’s already planning your wedding with Katerina.”\\n\\nKyle reached for me, but I stepped back. “Sofia... you’re the one I want to marry. Please, don’t do this to us. I will figure something out.”\\n\\n“You’re the one who did this to us! I love you, but this is too much. I need space. I need time to think.”\\n\\nSomething dangerous crossed his face. “If you leave now, I won’t be chasing you.”\\n\\nOf all the things he’d say, that line never crossed my mind.\\n\\n“Mom threatened to disown me if I didn’t marry Katerina. And you leaving me this way...” his long lash gaze pierced my soul when he met my eyes. “I have nothing left to lose.”\\n\\nMy mouth ran dry. How could he reverse the situation as if I were the one ending this relationship? I am not the one who slept with Katerina!\\n\\n“I was ready to give up everything for you... if you leave me now, you will lose me forever.”\\n\\n“Are you seriously giving me an ultimatum?”\\n\\nHe raked his hair roughly. “You don’t know how long I’ve been fighting for this relationship, Sofia. All I am asking is time to fix this, and you can’t even give me that.”\\n\\nConfrontations had always been Kyle’s expertise. He could twist the law in his sleep. He always finds a loophole, and he’s using that to his advantage.\\n\\nMy anger got the best of me. I jutted my chin up, meeting his gaze defiantly. “Well, you don’t have to fight for anything anymore, Kyle.”\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe sun is not up yet. I glanced left to right on the empty street, shifting from one foot to another. This is the last place I’d see myself after breaking my engagement off.\\n\\nDrawing in a deep breath, I pressed the doorbell to Georgia’s place. The silence of this neighborhood was sullen, and her footsteps as she approached the door were like a drum roll to the plot twist of my story.\\n\\n“This better be a life and death-“ her sleep-laced voice halted as she took in my appearance. “What the heck happened to you, Sofia?”\\n\\n“Oh.” I glanced down at Kyle’s shirt and joggers. They swallow my small frame like a blanket. My hair was a tangled mess, no less, and my face was no better. “Can I come in?”\\n\\nWithout missing a beat, she stepped aside and allowed me in.\\n\\nShe led me to the kitchen. I sat on the stool by the breakfast bar while Georgia busied herself on the coffee machine. As the machine purred gently, she faced me and crossed her arms. “You are here for a reason.”\\n\\nI sighed. Georgia is the last person I’d confide in about my problems. We are not friends. She doesn’t like me for a reason I still can’t figure out, but she holds my ticket out of this town. “I want the client in Rio.”\\n\\nHer perfectly shaped brows twitched. It was so small I barely missed it. The coffee machine beeped. Each second, as she filled two cups of coffee, dragged slowly.\\n\\nShe offered me a cup, taking the chair across from mine. She sipped her coffee slowly, peering at me over her cup. “Convince me to give it to you.”\\n\\nOn the way here, I had already perfected the story I would give her, but I didn’t think lying to Georgia would get me anywhere, so I told her the truth.\\n\\n“I know you hate me, but I really need to get away from here,” I added when she kept silent. I’d like to give myself a pat on the shoulder to not cry in front of my boss.\\n\\n“I don’t ‘hate’ you,” she said, her voice gentle and careful.\\n\\n“You don’t like me,” I pressed.\\n\\n“Yes, I don’t,” she chuckled, tucking her fiery red hair behind her ears.\\n\\nI let out a breath, ready to make my case, but she surprised me again by saying, “you got the job.”\\n\\n“Yeah?” I asked, bewildered. “Uhm, thank you.” I kept my composure when deep inside, I was celelarkering this small victory.\\n\\nGeorgia nodded, sipping her coffee.\\n\\n“One question,” I said, hoping this won’t affect her decision. “Why?”\\n\\n“Because I see myself in you, Sofia.”\\n\\n~~\\n\\nI had never been a light traveler. Packing my necessities in two hours was a record-breaking success in my lifetime.\\n\\nThroughout the drive to the airport, Georgia’s words played like a song out of tune in my head. I didn’t press on what she meant by it. She volunteered to cover for me in the office and why the sudden change of plans. I didn’t ask why she was so willing to help me. She had her reasons, and I had mine. As long as I get to get away from here, I don’t mind what hidden agenda Georgia has.\\n\\nThe sun was already up when I reached the airport. Georgia promised our company driver, Efraim, would meet me there with my plane ticket and client files. I have no idea how she’ll get me a flight on short notice, but I have to trust her.\\n\\nWith his bald head and beer belly, Efraim wasn’t hard to spot in the crowd, even though he was three inches shorter than me. Holding a manila envelope in one hand, he waved and offered a huge grin.\\n\\n“Ms. G said you’re leaving?” he asked, ptootshieing the envelope.\\n\\n“For business,” I said, avoiding a longer conversation with Efraim. “Georgia got me a flight?” I asked, looking for a plane ticket inside the envelope, brows furrowing when I found none.\\n\\n“She didn’t,” Efraim answered, chuckling.\\n\\n“What?” panic rose from the pit of my belly.\\n\\nI don’t expect Kyle to come after me, but I’d like to avoid any confrontation with him if I could. If he changed his mind, he had the resources to know where to find me.\\n\\n“She got you a private jet.”\\n\\n“What?” I repeated my question in a whisper.\\n\\n~~\\n\\nBewildered, I sat on the flush gray leather seat, taking in the palatial interior of Mr. Montiero’s private jet. In front of me was a gltootshie table and another set of 2 chairs. Wedge on the other side of the plane was a comfy-looking long couch. It appears to be softer than the bed I sleep in every night.\\n\\n“Miss Collins, would you like tea, coffee, water?” a very attractive, groomed, blond young woman, smiled pleasantly. She wore the sharpest charcoal suit jacket and white shirt I had ever seen.\\n\\n“A gltootshie of water, thank you,” I said, suddenly feeling thirsty.\\n\\nShe looked thoughtful for a while, taking my appearance in. Thinking I’d be flying on an economy flight, I dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.

Their first production was a fruity melodrama, now The Appleton Ladies’ Potato Race, a comedy with messages of equality and inclusivity. Later this year they will present the landmark Australian play Cosi, finishing up the year with A Vicar of Dibley Christmas - The Second Coming (plus a Youth Theatre production and a pantomime). The general public are certainly getting more than their money’s worth!\\n\\nThe play is set in the small (fictional) country town of Appleton in the Southern Highlands of NSW, where the annual show includes carrying large sacks of potatoes round a racetrack. The winner of the men’s race gets $1000, while the winner of the women’s race wins a paltry $200. New doctor and returning resident Penny Anderson sees this as completely unfair and sets out to right the wrong.\\n\\nPlaywright Melanie Tait takes real-life events and brings us a warm comedy showing the world that there’s more than one way to win a race. It is a look at the way country life has been affected by the 21st century and how it responds to the influx of sexual preferences, immigrant influences on food and attitudes and the adaptation of traditional values to modern ideals. Sounds heavy, but it is anything but that.\\n\\nDirector Selena Carr (together with Samuel Creighton) has designed an ingenious set with an open area that serves multiple scenes and side stages that open and close to reveal a hairdressing salon and a doctor’s surgery. The set is lined with corrugated iron with a scrim across the back that is used for back projection.\\n\\nCarr wisely focusses on the humanity of the play and brings to life five very believable women who trigger ‘aha’ moments with the audience. Personally, I could see elements of my mother, aunt, and grandmother in these very different personalities.\\n\\nIt is a busy show with many scenes, voice overs, and lighting states. Thanks to props (Beth Venning), lighting and sound (Zack Brittan and Mike Phillips) and a busy stage manager (Tom Moore), the production runs without a hitch.\\n\\nSonja Lawrance gives Penny Anderson, the doctor returned to the country to start a medical practice, gravitas, and heart. She is the linchpin of the play and drives the pace and storyline. Her scene with Bev Armstrong is moving.\\n\\nHeather Riley is tradition personified on the surface, but with the veneer scraped off, she is a vulnerable woman with her own cross to bear. As mentioned above, the doctor’s office scene is a highlight.\\n\\nChris Galipo’s Barb Ling is a woman with a secret which I will not reveal here. The secret she has been hiding ties up the loose ends of the play nicely. Her monologue with the washing basket in act two is an emotional glimpse into her mind.\\n\\nHayley Mitchell plays the ‘loud’ Nikki Armstrong to perfection. It would be easy to caricature this role, Mitchell plays her to the hilt without ever overstepping. Her dance routine at the start of act two is wonderful.\\n\\nKahlia Feuerreiter stepped into the role of Rania Hamid ten days before the opening night. Not that you would know. Her accent is perfect. Her balancing act in desiring acceptance, integration and sharing of cultures, whilst also standing up for what she believes in and experiencing both outright and casual racism, is much too familiar with many Australian migrants’ stories and is handled sensitively.\\n\\nThe Appleton Ladies’ Potato Race carries an important message but presents it using humour making it far more palatable. Go and see it. You will be highly entertained and come home with more than a few questions to ponder.\\n\\nBarry Hill OAM Tea Tree Players Theatre Tea Tree Players is a thriving all-ages community theatre group within the City of Tea Tree Gully.'}, {'label': 0, 'text': 'As part of National Reconciliation Week, Willagee Community Centre is excited to present this singing workshop in Noongar language with award winning actor and singer Della Rae Morrison. \\n\\nDella Rae is the Music Director for Madjitil Moorna community choir who perform in Noongar language and has performed in various theatre, film and TV series including Bran Nue Dae.\\n\\nDate: Tuesday, 30 May\\nTime: 10.00am to 12.00noon\\nVenue: Willagee Community Centre\\n\\nFree event - bookings essential via phone | 08 9364 0848 or email wcc.bookings@melville.wa.gov.au\\n\\nVisit melville.com.au/nrw to see all activities taking place across National Reconciliation Week.

While we can turn blame to “Driver behaviour” \\n\\nI am of the belief that when we build roads, Driver behaviour should be part of safety and development. Many of our roads are in my opinion unsafe. \\n\\nThe truth is, I ran for local government to be a voice for the community. I was a naïve nurse who thought I could make a difference. But there is something seriously wrong and dangerous about what is occurring on council. \\n\\nEvery time I advocate, I am attacked by councillors where it hurts the most, my culture and my identity. My very self. \\n\\nIt started off being told I and First Nation’s people’s want our own country, this is not true. \\n\\nIt then went onto not believing into Aboriginal Self-Determination, which is everyone’s human right. \\n\\nI was then backed into a corner by fellow councillors told to not make trouble, ridiculed, and asked if I want to leave. \\n\\nThen the blackmailing started followed by more stand over tactics and more racist hate towards me and Melton’s first nation’s community. Internal comments that First Nation’s people can go to “St Albans” for services. A comment which speaks to me, some councillors do not welcome us here. It is important to note that internal minutes are either barred from being taken or regularly lost to hide such incidents. Unprofessional and dangerous. \\n\\nDerogatory comments and statements directed at culturally specific sites. \\n\\nI was busy working on a COVID Ward making sure people could get back home to their families and didn’t have time to educate and it is not my role. I made a complaint about the racism I experienced and sought training for councillors. They were disgusted and my complaint has been deleted and “lost”. \\n\\nThere is an entire section in FOI documents that speaks to the planning of blackmailing me, some even went to extreme lengths.\\nI was ambushed in a meeting with Goran the Mayor at the time and Lara Carli the deputy Mayor and presented with a document created by a third councillor where I was denied right of reply, stood over and intimidated. I have raised this complaint and met with the current Mayor Lara and she has blocked and denied my request for action and support. I have made it known I feel unsafe. \\n\\nI have been instructed what to say, what to do, have information withheld from me and at times pressured into deleting resident comments and editing messaging, otherwise my work is not supported. I am held hostage as an elected representative. \\n\\nIn the most recent display of racial vilification on a day that meant so much to me and my family, Sorry day. (City of Melton held our Sorry day early) it is a day to acknowledge the strength of Stolen Generation's Survivors and reflect on how we can all share in the healing process. \\n\\nMy family, my mother was ripped from my nan’s arms, barred from her culture, stripped of her identity, and abused on levels much of as could not imagine as a young girl. What she endured was and is Horrific. \\n\\nI have on several occasions requested City of Melton to stop doing it to me as my rights are protected, all our rights are.\\n\\nI met with The Mayor, Lara Carli the evening of the event however, she purposely, willfully and knowingly chose to erase my culture, my identity and continue the perpetration of the stolen generation. \\n\\nShe did so because she believes she is like me, I am a proud Wiradjuri/Nari Nari woman who has been impacted by the stolen generation. No Lara, you are not me. \\n\\nTo add insult to injury in this meeting she ridiculed my culture and that of all first nations and made derogatory statements in the presence of our CEO, that her and other Councillors would like “titles”. No Lara, these are not titles, these are our identity, our culture our heritage, much like you use names and surnames. \\n\\nIt is what you and people like you stole from us, barred us from doing, continue to steal from us and it is what you did to me. It is the most serious crime you could ever commit against a first nation’s person. \\n\\nTo add further insult to injury, Cultural competency training is a must, for reasons mentioned above, The Mayor, Lara Carli has continued to complain to our CEO that she wants erase it and create a “ALL” cultures training. \\n\\nI have requested that our CEO refer the matter to Victoria Police for action, because racial vilification is a crime and every time I speak up my complaints are blocked, deleted, lost or simply ignored and I am racially targeted and attacked.

We are indeed in big, big trouble⚠️\\n\\n🔘 Each church is promised that everyone who conquers will be rewarded by Christ... Sadly the mainstream Churches today believe the church is a democracy and what the majority of their attendees want they can get. They only need to vote. This is a lie from satan himself. God is not a Democracy. His Laws and Commandments can not be voted away, they can only be obeyed. \\n\\n🔘 The 7 churches is representing 7 different periods in the history of the Western Church from the time of Paul until the return of Jesus Christ.\\n\\n🔘 Laodicea is our period and has the unfortunate distinction of being the only church that receives no positive commentary, whatsoever. God is not happy with the state the churches are in today...\\n\\n🔘 Laodicea ( WE) is charged with being spiritually inert: lukewarm, rather than either hot or cold. This evokes the disgusting sensation of room-temperature water in one\\'s mouth. \\n\\n🔘Jesus heavily criticized this church ( US) for being arrogant and apathetic. Rather than being spiritually passionate, they are passive. Instead of being cold, meaning they are more likely to respond to the gospel, they are just familiar enough with God to brush Him off. Jesus still offers a chance for repentance—but He describes Himself as \"outside\", knocking at the door and expecting them to answer (Revelation 3:14–22).\\n\\n🔘 Sadly we can see in Revelations 3:14-22 that Jesus is not inside the mainstream Church. He is outside knocking. This means none of these churches belongs to him or does His will... \\n\\n🔘 The message is from the Lord Jesus Christ via an angel or messenger (likely a reference to the church’s pastor): “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write . . .” (Revelation 3:14). This was not simply John’s message to those in Laodicea or us; it was a message from the Lord HIMSELF. Jesus identifies Himself thus: “The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation.” These titles emphasize the Lord’s faithfulness, sovereignty, and power to bring all things to their proper completion (the “Amen”).\\n\\n🔘 In contrast to the other 6 churches, the Laodicean church has nothing to commend it. Jesus begins the message with condemnation: \\n\\n😥“I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. \\n\\n😪You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked” (Revelation 3:15-17). \\n\\n🔘 Jesus emphasizes their  (our) “lukewarm,” apathetic nature three times. As a result of their ambivalence to spiritual things, Jesus would have nothing to do with them. He would “spit them out,” as the people of Laodicea would spit out the tepid water that flowed from the underground aqueducts to their city. With their apathy came spiritual blindness; they claimed to be rich, blessed, and self-sufficient. \\n\\n▪️ Perhaps they were rich in material things. But, spiritually, the Laodiceans (US) were in a wretched, pitiful condition, made all the worse in that they could not see their need. \\n\\n⚠️This (WE) are a church filled with self-deceived hypocrites.\\n\\n🔘Jesus calls the Laodicean church ( US) to repent of its sin: “I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see” (Revelation 3:18). Their material wealth had no eternal benefit, so Jesus commands them to come to Him for true, spiritual riches (see Isaiah 55:1-2). Only Christ can supply an everlasting inheritance, clothe us in righteousness, and heal our spiritual blindness.\\n\\n🔘Jesus then notes His concern for His church in Laodicea: “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent. Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me” (Revelation 3:19-20). His rebuke is not born of animosity but of love. “The Lord disciplines those he loves” (Hebrews 12:6). The desired response to God’s reproof was zealous change and true repentance.\\n\\n🔘Verse 20 is often used as an evangelistic appeal, yet its original context communicates Christ’s desire for fellowship with His lukewarm church in Laodicea (US). The church is nominally Christian, \\n\\n⚠️but Christ Himself has been locked out. He is not part of them(us)\\n\\n🔘Rather than turn His back on them (us), He knocks, seeking someone to acknowledge the church’s need and open the door. If they would repent, Jesus would come in and take His rightful place in the church. He would share a meal with them, a Middle Eastern word picture speaking of the closeness of the relationship.\\n\\n💜Jesus then makes a promise to the believers in Laodicea: “To him who overcomes, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne” (Revelation 3:21). The “overcomer” refers to any believer, and the promise is that he will share Christ’s future kingdom.\\n\\n🔘In summary👇\\n\\n The mainstream churches today had become apathetic in their love for Christ. They ( We) were allowing “the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things 👉 (openly sins and disobeying clear important commandments from God by voting them out as unessential or traditional nonsense) [to] come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful” (Mark 4:19). There is no difference between Christians and worldly people today, we and they acting and looking the same......Christ called them (US) to repent and live zealously for Him, to “choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve” (Joshua 24:15). The Lord Jesus issues the same call to those who say they follow Him today.\\n\\nKind regards in Christ 💜'}, {'label': 1, 'text': 'The Labor Albanese Voice is losing momentum simply because there is no compromise being considered.

The Mayor said that \"Children are never too young to receive such messages\" she was referring to books which cover queer theory, trans ideology and gender identity. \\n\\nSome of the books include:\\n\\n1. Jacob’s School Play Starring He, She, and They which - “introduces readers to gender identity and pronoun use”\\n\\n2. She’s my dad - “an illustrated picture book that tells the story of Mini and her dad Haley, a transgender woman” \\n\\n3. The hips on the Drag go swish swish swish - “a quirky twist on a classic nursery rhyme by illustrating all of the ways to \"work it\". The story plays off \"The Wheels on the Bus\" as it follows a drag queen who performs her routine in front of an awestruck audience.”   \\n\\n4. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo - “explores issues of same sex marriage”\\n\\n5. Bunny Bear - “Although Bunnybear was born a bear, he feels more like a bunny….The other bears don\\'t understand him, and neither do the bunnies.”\\n\\nThese books will only confuse children and the Mayor is sticking by her decision to push these ideologies onto kids. The Mayor and the councillors are not backing down. They’re determined for children to be exposed to this content. They’ll hide behind buzz words like inclusivity and inclusion but really it’s indoctrination and confusion. \\n\\nThe Mayors contact details are below. Get in touch with her and voice your concerns.

Her father had built it from a dream he\\'d had, or so he\\'d told us when we were young girls. Looking at it now, I believed it. Little did I know that, in this house, all of my dreams would start to come true.\\n\\nFive years had gone by since the last time I came to Miami. Pulling up to Tally\\'s house felt just like it had been so many times before. I had spent so many summers in this home, coming here was like greeting an old friend. \\n\\nThe mansion had tall, white, towering columns lining the porch, accenting the huge archways over the doors. The architecture was unique to Tally\\'s father\\'s taste, which made sense since he had dreamed it up. \\n\\nThe difference now was the roof had been redone in Mediterranean terracotta shingles, and the landscaping was completely different, now with an Italian flare. Mr. Valentino had even added a white marble fountain to the front yard that featured a goddess being worshiped. He had really outdone himself and based on the looks of the outside, I couldn\\'t wait to see what he had changed inside. This was my home away from home. \\n\\n“Oh, my god!\"\" Tally screamed excitedly. “Look at this place! Dad really did a number on the renovations, didn\\'t he, Becca?\"\"\\n\\n“Yeah, totally awesome,\"\" I replied, glancing towards Tally, shaking my head.\\n\\nThank god she has never been to my parents\\' house. As much as I didn\\'t want to think Tally would judge the way I grew up—she would. Prim and proper was Tally\\'s norm. These sorts of luxuries weren\\'t possible for someone like me.\\n\\nI didn\\'t come from mansions or luxury cars or tight security. My family didn\\'t have yachts and butlers and maids. All of which seemed to tend to any need Tally could possibly ever have. But it didn\\'t matter to me in the end. I loved the life I lived, and I was grateful to have been able to take part in Tally\\'s as well.\\n\\nHow we had become friends I would never understand, but I was grateful to have her. We had been there for each other through a lot, and no matter how much we could irritate each other, we were like sisters.\\n\\n“I\\'m starving. I wonder if Dad has a small spread ready for our arrival,\"\" she murmured as she grabbed her stuff and glanced at me. “Ready to get this party started?\"\"\\n\\n“Sure.\"\" Shaking my head with a smile, I watched her move with excitement towards the front door. Its mahogany finish gleamed in the Miami sun. Beautiful. That\\'s what it was.\\n\\nPassing the threshold, it was as if being instantly transported to Italy. The decor embellished every inch of the Tuscan Valley, highlighting every aspect of the magical home. The last time I had come here was when Tally\\'s parents got divorced. At that point in time, the home was still wildly styled to Tally\\'s mother\\'s taste. So seeing her father\\'s preference brought to life was a refreshing sight. \\n“Daddy!\"\" Tally screamed, dropping all of her bags to the floor haphazardly as she moved towards the kitchen. “I\\'m home!\"\"\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure why Tally continued to act like she was five, but at the same time, I was too entranced with the decor to care. Carefully, I sat done my things next to Tally\\'s while my eyes stared at the ceiling as I spun slowly in a circle, taking it all in.\\n\\n“Maybe he isn\\'t here,\"\" I said as my eyes met hers once more. \\n“He is here. His car was in the drive, and he told me he had a long meeting. That\\'s why he didn\\'t meet us at the airport.\"\"\\n\\nRolling my eyes, my face must express a smirk as I took a seat on one of the tall vintage barstools. There was only so much Tally-drama I could deal with, and considering we hadn\\'t even been here ten minutes, I would say this was a new record. Regardless, though, I didn\\'t want to partake in the conversation she was about to have with him. I already knew where it would go. \\n\\n“Well,\"\" I shrugged, “maybe he took another car?\"\" \\n\\nIt\\'s not like he is short on the money to afford it.\\n\\n“This is not right!\"\" Tally screamed out in frustration. “He was supposed to greet me as soon as I got home.\"\"\\n\\nAh. There she is! Princess Tally at her finest. As my eyes cast towards the window in the kitchen, I caught sight of the Adonis-like figure swimming laps in the pool. There was no doubt in my mind who it was....Because I already knew. James Valentino. Tally\\'s father.\\n\\nSince I was sixteen years old, I had thought about him. I knew it was wrong, but at the same time, it was a childish fantasy. One I never dared to share with Tally. Not to mention her father would never dare take advantage of a young girl. \\n\\n“Uh, it looks like he is getting out of the pool,\"\" I breathed out, trying to divert my attention.\\nNo matter how many times I tried to take my eyes off of him, I couldn\\'t. He was far too breathtaking. Oh dear God. Is he getting more attractive the older he gets?\\n\\n“What?\"\" She gasped as she glanced in the direction I was looking. “Swimming instead of meeting me when I walked through the door?\"\"\\n\\nThe disdain in her voice snapped me out of my trance and caused me to roll my eyes.\\n\\n“I don\\'t understand what the big deal is, Tally. Who cares? We are here now, and we have an entire summer to enjoy.\"\"\\n\\nShe spun to face me; her gaze spoke volumes about her unhappiness. “I know this.\"\"\\n“Sooo?\"\" I shrugged. “Then what\\'s the big deal?\"\"\\n\\nCrossing her arms, she scoffed, “Because Daddy always greets me at the door. You don\\'t think he has a new woman, do you?\"\"\\nLaughter escapes me as I stare at her in disbelief. “Seriously? That\\'s your go-to?\"\"\\n“Well—\"\" she shrugged in frustration, “I read online that when men change their patterns, it\\'s usually because of a big change... like a new woman.\"\"\\n\\nShould have seen that. It\\'s what happened with Chad, I silently noted with a sigh. I couldn\\'t understand her reasoning. “Would that honestly be a bad thing?\"\"\\n“Yes!\"\" she shrieked. “Oh, my god, Becca. That would be like the worst thing ever. If he wants a woman, he can get back with my mom.\"\"\\n\\nJust as she said the words, the sliding glass door opened, and the most attractive man I had ever laid my eyes on stepped through the doorway. The Italian Stallion has arrived. God, he is so charming.\\n\\nThe unbelievable remark running through my mind caused me to hold myself as my eyes could not stop staring at him. No matter how much time passed, I still had the imagination to be around him into the new year.  I would do anything to make him happy. I don’t mind, I\\'m not picky.\\n\\n“Where were you?\"\" Tally snapped with disapproval, pulling me from my delicious thoughts. “I expected to see you, and you weren\\'t there. I don\\'t understand.\"\"\\n\\nConfusion passed through his eyes as he stared at her with shock. “Sweetie, I didn\\'t think your flight was supposed to be here for another hour.\"\"\\n\\n“Uh–no,\"\" she quipped. “I sent you my flight info, and I texted you.\"\"\\n“You did?\"\" he replied, picking his phone off the bar and quickly scrolling through it.\\nStanding impatiently, she stared at him. “Yeah, I did.\"\"\\n“I\\'m sorry, sweetie,\"\" he shrugged. “I guess it slipped my mind. I\\'ll make it up to you.\"\"\\nSmart man. Smart man.\\n\\nWhen it came to Tally, we both knew how to act. Because if Tally didn\\'t get her way, you would think World War III was breaking out due to her disregard and meltdowns.\\n\\n“It\\'s okay,\"\" she sighed. “Becca and I are hungry and tired. Can we order food?\"\"\\nAs his eyes slowly slid to me, he furrowed his brow in confusion, “Becca?\"\"\\n\\nOf course, he doesn\\'t recognize me. “Hey,\"\" I smiled, trying not to look down.\\n\\nThis man was really difficult to ignore, and with my nonexistent romance for the past few weeks, I was completely distracted. Come on now, Becca. Stop thinking weird about your friend\\'s dad. What on earth are you thinking!\\n\\n“You have grown up a lot, Becca,\"\" Mr. Valentino replied, his dark, sultry gaze scanning up and down me. \\n\\nOh gosh. Was he checking me out?!\\n\\n“Yeah.\"\" The breathlessness of my response caused me to clear my throat as I quickly averted my gaze, trying to look anywhere but at him. I wasn\\'t trying to be rude, but if this conversation didn\\'t end quickly, I was going to give away my unrealistic thoughts by looking at his charming look.\\n\\n“So...\"\" he muttered, looking between the two of us. “What are the plans for summer?\"\"\\nBefore I could even get a word in, Tally started rambling off about the parties and boating trips she wanted to take. Even though I was her guest, he was already accustomed to the fact we often did things apart.\\n\\n“And you, Becca?\"\" he asked, bringing me back to the present. “Anything you would like to do?\"\"\\nYeah, dreaming about you.\\n\\n“Um. I\\'m not quite sure yet. Had some rough stuff happen a few weeks back, so kind of looking to relax and enjoy my summer? Then, it\\'s back to school for my last year.\"\" I smiled, nodding my head as a glint of amusement crossed his eyes.\\n\\n“Oh, very nice,\"\" he said, crossing his arms. “What was your degree again?\"\"\\n\\n“Statistics and Data Science,\"\" I replied as I gazed down at my fidgeting hands.\\n\\n“She\\'s a math nerd, Dad. You give her anything to do with numbers, and she is quick with a response. Bookkeeping and calculations and all that stuff. Kind of like you.\"\"\\n\\nTally\\'s response caused me to laugh before I cleared my throat, realizing I was finding amusement in her calling her dad a math nerd, basically. \\n\\n“Something like that,\"\" his reply was followed by making a little expression on his face as my gaze met his once more. I didn\\'t understand what was going through his head at that moment, but I was intrigued to find out.\\n\\nPulling out her phone, I watched as Tally replied to whatever text she got while smacking on the bright pink bubble gum she had consumed at some point. “Oh dear. Becca, we need to get unpacked. Jesse wants us to meet for food.\"\"\\n\\n“Oh–okay,\"\" I said, not really looking forward to it. “I thought we were going to eat here.\"\"\\n“I can order food,\"\" Mr. Valentino said happily as he glanced between Tally and I. \\n“No, no,\"\" Tally scoffed. “We are just going to go out.\"\"\\n\\nI felt bad about the situation overall. Mr. Valentino didn\\'t know we were going to be here so soon, and Tally was acting childish. Even if I loved her dearly, the way she was acting was unacceptable.\\n\\n“Okay then,\"\" he smiled. “It\\'s really nice to have you home, sweetie. I hope we can spend some time together while you\\'re here.\"\"\\n\\nThe notion warmed my heart and made me miss my own father. But in true Tally fashion, she didn\\'t hold the same sweet sentiment I did.\\n\\n“I\\'ll fit something in,\"\" she replied as she made her way towards the stairs. “Can Rosa bring our things upstairs, please? I need to unpack and take a shower.\"\"\\n\\nAs Tally disappeared from sight, I shook my head, jumping off the barstool.\\n“Thanks for letting me stay for the summer, Mr. Valentino. I appreciate it.\"\"\\n\\nHis eyes drifted from where his daughter had disappeared to me, and as he looked at me, I couldn\\'t help but feel small under his gaze. “There is no need to thank me, Becca. Also, will you please call me James?\"\"\\n\\nFirst name basis? Oh, gosh… Becca, stop, you\\'re reading too much into it.\\n“If that\\'s what you would like… James,\"\" I replied softly, fluttering my eyelashes. “I better get going. I guess I\\'ll see you around.\"\"\\n\\nRaising a brow, his smile never faltered as he nodded, “Oh, you definitely will.\"\"\\nGoing out with Tally had been more of a headache than I wanted it to be. What started out with dinner turned into an all-nighter at a local club. The stench of stale stuff littered my clothing from earlier in the night, as well as, the few droplets of puke Tally had managed to get on me when I was near her.\\nIt shouldn\\'t have been much of a surprise how the evening turned out. Yet, once again, I was left to babysit her while she dabbled in the fun. \\n\\nI wasn\\'t the party girl Tally had become, and even though she knew that, she still tried to drag me around. Sometimes I wondered if that was simply a way to make sure she had a designated driver or if she genuinely enjoyed my company.\\n\\nBy the time we had arrived back at her home, the lights were off, and it was dark. Tally was unable to carry herself up the stairs, which meant that it had been my job to do so.\\nLucky me!\\n\\nAfter I had helped Tally with her dress and put her in bed, and a hot shower had washed away the remainder of the night from myself, I lay on my bed, trying to find the will to go to sleep. Too much had happened over the past few weeks. My mind still reeled from my breakup with Chad, but I also couldn\\'t stop thinking about James.\\n\\nJames was different. Not only was he incredibly attractive, with his perfect look I wanted to be around him for days, but he was old school. He seemed like the kind of man who knew how to wine and dine a girl. Treat her special, and never cheat on her with some mystery girl like Chad did to me. \\n\\nI didn\\'t know James that way, but my mind constantly wondered. I wondered how he would treat me and about all the wonderful things he could do to me. I didn\\'t understand the rush of emotions he brought over me. I wasn\\'t the bad girl type, and yet everything about him wanted to make me just be around him.\\n\\nI\\'m an unreasonable person to think a man like James Valentino would be interested in me though. Allison, Tally\\'s mom, is beautiful and classy. She has taste and is sophisticated… I can never be her.\\nTally had plenty of male friends in this city, and even though I didn\\'t want another relationship, I couldn\\'t help but wonder if one of them would want to be with me. \\nPicking up my phone, I scrolled through social media and took in the various photos of Chad and I that were posted on my account. I hadn\\'t had the courage to get rid of them yet, and looking back at it now, I felt even more pathetic.\\n\\nWith a push of a few buttons and much-needed courage, I deleted the history of my relationship with Chad. I welcomed the hollow feeling when I was finished, but at the same time, it hurt.\\n“God, why can\\'t I sleep,\"\" I groaned as I looked at the clock, realizing I had spent two hours lying awake instead of sleeping.\\n\\nSlipping from bed, I padded my way out of my room and towards the stairs. The idea of hot tea and a snack to settle my mind seemed more enjoyable with every step I took.\\n\\nThrough the darkness, I made my way to the kitchen. The dim light over the stove was enough for me to see what I was doing, and yet, not disturb anyone in the home. Not that anyone would likely wake. It was 3:00 in the morning, and normal people slept at this hour. \\n\\nAs I moved around the kitchen setting the kettle, I hummed a tune from earlier in the night that had gotten stuck in my head. \\n\\n“Having fun?\"\" a voice called from behind me, causing a small scream to leave my throat as I spun around, coming face to face with James himself. His dark, brooding eyes stared at me with amusement.\\n\\nAs much as I wanted to form a coherent sentence at that moment, my thoughts were lost in the realization that James, my best friend\\'s father, was standing before me. \\nOh, sweet baby Jesus. “Uh-oh, hey. Sorry, just making tea.\"\"\\n\\n“I see that,\"\" he hummed with amusement. “Couldn\\'t sleep either?\"\"\\nShaking my head, I shrugged my shoulders. “Not lately. Plus, after all the excitement tonight, I had to wind down.\"\"\\n\\nThere was a moment of awkward silence that fell between us as James stood by the counter, simply staring at me. Clearing my throat, I turned back towards the kettle that was now hissing and poured the hot water over the tea bag so it could steep. Motion out of the corner of my eye made me freeze as I realized he had taken two steps towards me.\\n\\n“You really have changed over the years… haven\\'t you, Becca?\"\" he whispered softly, causing me to turn around and notice only a few feet between us.\\n\\nMy heart raced with anticipation of what was happening. Was this what I hoped it was? But I couldn\\'t do that to Tally, could I?\\n\\n“Yeah,\"\" I replied uncomfortably, “I guess I have. I\\'m not really the dorky girl I was the last time I was here. Then again, I could say you have changed as well.\"\"\\n\\nHe had changed. He had gotten older, obviously, but he didn\\'t seem as sad as he once had. Instead, he seemed satisfied with his life. As if he finally found his calling after leaving his ex-wife, Allison.\\n\\n“Interesting.\"\" His eyes took me in once more as he casually leaned against the counter. “So, did your boyfriend decide to join you this summer as well?\"\"\\n\\nMy eyes kept drifting down on him. His figure was hard to ignore. I tried not to look, but I couldn\\'t help it when he stood so willingly in front of me.\\n\\n“Uh, no.\"\" I shrugged, trying to remain calm. “I don\\'t have one. We broke up a few weeks ago.\"\"\\nIntrigue seemed to get to him as I responded. As if that had been the answer he was hoping for. \\n\\n“Is that right? Was it mutual then?\"\" \\n\\nGlancing down, I shook my head. “No, not exactly.\"\"\\n\\nNo matter how innocent his question had been, the wound of Chad\\'s betrayal was still fresh. So for James to bring it up was like pouring salt on an open wound.\\n\\n“I\\'m sorry if I upset you, Becca. That wasn\\'t my intention.\"\"\\n\\n“No, no. You\\'re fine,\"\" I replied as my eyes met his again. “Just, bad things happened, and it wasn\\'t the most joyous moment in my life. Nothing I won\\'t get over with in time, though.\"\"\\n\\nThere was an unmistakable fire that crossed his gaze for a moment at my words. I wasn\\'t sure what it was, but it was almost as if he was angry, but pleased at the same time.\\n\\n“He was not smart enough for letting a beautiful woman like you go.\"\" \\n\\nOh gosh, he just called me beautiful. The compliment caused my cheeks to redden with embarrassment as I tried to hold myself and quickly turned back to my tea.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure why his remark surprised me like it did. Men from his generation were notorious for being this way, or at least, that was the assumption I had with most men I knew his age. My professors and even my dad\\'s friends were from a generation of class. So why was it that his words caused me to react like this? Trying to wrap my head around what he was saying, I cleared my throat and straightened my shoulders. \\n\\n“Thank you for your compliment. But I am not as pretty as other women. Plus, I am driven when it comes to my career. So I wasn\\'t giving him the attention he wanted.\"\"\\n\\nExcuses. They were all excuses, but at the same time, these excuses were what allowed me to get past the pain I felt over Chad\\'s betrayal. The excuses I made were ones I gave for his actions towards me. No matter how horrible they were.\\n\\n“He didn\\'t deserve you. Traits like that I think are attractive in a woman,\"\" James replied moving next to me, causing my breath to catch in my throat. I was highly aware of the distance between us in the kitchen. The fact that we were being alone made me excited, and I hoped he couldn\\'t tell how much I felt. \\n\\nSlowly turning around, I faced him. In the time I hadn\\'t been paying attention, he had got himself there near me, and the distance between us caused my heart to race.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t trying to be bad, but the smell of him wrapping around me made me want to do all kinds of bad things. “Perhaps, someday, someone will show me what it is I deserve.\"\" \\n\\nMy words came off more suggestive than I\\'d meant them to be, and he must have noticed, because his response was to look at me gently as he moved toward me. Being near him did not help me with my imagination to be just with him. I wanted it so bad to happen, but at the same time, there was no way a man like James Valentino wanted me. Not to mention, you ungrateful girl, that is your best friend\\'s dad.\\n\\nAs he pulled back, setting his cup on the counter, I tried to clear my mind. There was a boundary I didn\\'t need to cross, and with the teasing moments around us, I was dangerously close to crossing.\\n\\n“Are you okay?\"\" he whispered, causing me to slowly look up at him to see the amusement dancing within his eyes.\\n\\n“Of course, why wouldn\\'t I be?\"\" I shifted uncomfortably. “Are you?\"\"\\n\\nAs his eyes drifted down, I felt the stir within me once more.\\n\\n“Oh, I\\'m more than alright, Becca.\"\" He grinned and his eyes met mine again. It took me a moment to process what he meant, and as I glanced down, I saw my little reaction. \\n\\n“Oh, I\\'m so sorry,\"\" I stammered, wrapping my arms. “It\\'s a bit cold.\"\"\\n\\n“No, it isn\\'t.\"\" He chuckled as he grabbed his glass and went to the fridge to pour a drink.  He may have been right, but the arrogant response made me surprise.\\n\\n“Yes, it is. It\\'s a bit chilly, and well, yeah—\"\" \\nAs the door to the fridge closed, he turned to face me, sipping from his cup. The movement of his Adam\\'s apple as he drank down the liquid caught my eye. I had never seen something as simple as that look so attractive before.\\n\\n“I know what you want, Becca,\"\" he said, grasping my attention once more.\\n\\n“I don\\'t want anything,\"\" I replied, trying to play the moment off.\\n\\n“Enough.\"\" Setting his cup down, he quickly cleared the space between us once more. \\n\\n“Mr. Valentino—\"\"\\n\\n“I told you to call me James, Becca.\"\" His firm reply flipped the switch on the situation and instantly made me want to behave. “I can see that you get excited, but I can promise you I\\'m not what you want. The things I would do… well, they would be too much for you.\"\"\\n\\nOh gees. “Y-you have no idea what I can handle. You don\\'t know me like that.\"\"\\n\\nMy stuttered response showed clearly how uneasy I was with this situation, and yet I wanted it. \\n\\n“Be a good girl, Becca. You need to go upstairs and go to bed,\"\" he whispered as he inhaled deeply and pushed himself back from where we stood. \\n\\nThe distance he was placing between us gave me a chance to breathe once more. Without a moment of hesitation, my feet pushed me towards the stairs, only he stopped me again. \\n\\n“Remember what I said,\"\" he all but growled in an amazing way that had frozen me. \\nTurning to face him, I tried to push him away. But the realization hit me that he was within my reach made everything worse. Snapping out of my daydream, I quickly freed myself from his grasp. He was there and he stared at me, making everything harder. \\n\\n“Goodnight, Mr. Valentino,\"\" I stuttered, forcing my gaze from his before I turned and fled from the kitchen, quickly running up the stairs.\\n\\nJames Valentino was a mysterious man, and there was no telling what he truly meant by what he\\'d said. Perhaps he was dangerous, but perhaps I would like it.\\nJames.\\n\\n“Daniel, as you can see, there are numerous ways we can better help you profit from your industry if you use our company. Our importing and exporting section far surpasses that of our competitors.\"\"\\nI watched as the CEO of Citadel Furnishing thought about my proposal. I had spent months trying to close this deal, and with weeks of back and forth, I knew without a doubt I had this in the bag. A smile lined the man\\'s face as he nodded. “Let\\'s do it,\"\" he replied, holding out his hand, which I quickly shook. \\n\\n“I look forward to our future business together. If you wait just a moment, I will have Evette bring in the paperwork for you to sign, and then we will have someone take you on a tour of the docks so you can see our company at its finest.\"\"\\n\\nEvette brought in the paperwork, Daniel signed it, and then I sent him off for the promised tour. Once he was gone, I reached for my phone which had gone off a few different times during my meeting. \\n\\nTally. \\n\\nThe girl was difficult, but as my only child, I loved her no matter what she did. She was the princess in my kingdom, and I was the king of my castle. For years I had tried to correct Tally\\'s behavior, but her mother was always an obstacle.\\n\\n\\'Having people over today for a pool party.\\'\\nShaking my head, I sighed. There was no arguing with this girl.\\n\\'That\\'s fine. I will be home later this afternoon. Do you girls need anything?\\'\\nA few moments passed, and I watched the small bubbles at the bottom of our chat move. \\n\\'We\\'re fine. See.\\'\\nA photo pushed through on my screen, and I smiled at my beautiful daughter, Tally, dressed with a straw hat and cover-up over her bathing suit. She was beautiful, just like her mother.\\n\\'You look beautiful, sweetie. Be safe, see you soon. Xx\\'\\nAs soon as I sent the text, though, another photo came through, and it was one that made me internally groan. My hand was tightening on the phone as I stared down at the smiling face. It was of Becca. My daughter\\'s beautiful friend who was supposed to be off limits.\\n\\nFrom the moment I laid eyes on Becca, I felt something towards her. A curiosity, a hunger that made me want to know more. I knew it was wrong, but god, was she the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her hair was up in a high ponytail, showing off her beauty. A black bathing suit looked very good on her. I enjoyed the sight very much. \\n\\nNever once before did an interest of the girl come across my mind until now, and yet, even though I tried my hardest not to take interest, I couldn\\'t help it. The once ordinary young girl had grown into a beautiful tall brunette with blue eyes and a figure most women would die for.\\n\\nSeeing her the other night in the kitchen was a surprise, but remembering her stretching up into the cabinet, the thought of her made realize how bad I was attracted to her. She was very spectacular, and I wanted nothing more than to be with her. \\n\\nI was not proud with my own thought, but as if my charm prowess took over, it quickly dissipated. I wanted her more than I had ever wanted anyone. I needed to be happy. As if on cue, my office door opened, and in walked a tall blonde with a flashy make-up. Her tight blue dress matches her well, but the problem was she wasn\\'t who I wanted to see. \\n\\n“Katrine. To what do I owe the pleasure?\"\"\\nShe smiled as she pushed my chair back and sat next to me.\\n\\n“Why haven\\'t you come to see me?\"\" Her thick Russian accent washed over me as she leaned back batting her lashes. “I had to wait a week and come see you here.\"\"\\n\\n“I told you, Katrine, I am busy right now.\"\"\\n\\nHer brows furrowed as she put on a pout which may have worked on most men, but not me. Tally had perfected that look, and I had grown well accustomed to not falling for it.\\n\\n“I thought you would miss me,\"\" she whined as I exhaled with irritation.\\nPinching the bridge of my nose, I shook my head and moved away from her.\\n\\n“I told you that I don\\'t do the emotions thing, Katrine.\"\" \\nShe looked surprised, and her eyes narrowed. “We have been seeing each other for months–\"\"\\n\\n“Yes, and as I told you the first time… there is nothing else that will happen. It\\'s just fun, Katrine, and you told me you understood that. I don\\'t understand why you came to my company.\"\" \\n\\nWe had one rule, and she knows what it was. \\n\\n“You are mine, James.\"\" Her response was firm as she crossed her arms. “I don\\'t understand why you are acting like this. Don\\'t I make you happy?\"\"\\n\\nIt was clear this conversation wasn\\'t going anywhere, and with my next appointment arriving in less than an hour, I had things I needed to get done. \\n\\n“Evette!\"\" I yelled, watching as the door opened to reveal my very punctual assistant.\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Valentino?\"\" \\n\\n“Can you please escort Katrine to her car?\"\" I asked her, watching as a look of shock crossed Katrine\\'s face.\\n\\n“Of course.\"\" Evette reached out to Katrine but was quickly pushed back by the rage that began to build beneath her once enticing eyes.\\n\\n“Are you throwing me out?!\"\" she shrieked. “You can\\'t do this to me!\"\"\\n\\nAmusement filled me as I leaned back in my chair and watched her. That\\'s unattractive. Perhaps this is for the best.\\n\\n“I think you will see that I can. I appreciate your attention, Katrine, but they will no longer be needed. I do wish you all the best for the future.\"\"\\n\\nCold. That was how I had to be. I never meant to hurt the women I had relations with, but I couldn\\'t allow them to think it would be more.\\n\\nI was always cast as the bad guy. No matter how many times I told them from the start I didn\\'t want an exclusive relationship, and there would be nothing more than fun, they never listened to me.\\n\\n“You will regret doing this to me!\"\" Katrine warned, causing me to smile.\\n“Is that a threat, Miss Solkova?\"\"\\n\\nLaughing, she shook her head. “No, that\\'s a promise. Karma will get you.\"\"\\nTurning on her heels, she stormed from my office with Evette left to stand there staring at me.\\n\\n“Mr. Valentino, may I say something?\"\"\\n“Of course, Evette. What\\'s on your mind?\"\" I replied.\\n“If I am going to start having to play defense for you when it comes to women like that… I am going to have to request a raise, bonus, or something.\"\"\\nI laughed at her statement. “Is that right?\"\"\\n“Yes, sir. Call it hazard pay if you will.\"\" Evette sighed, shaking her head. “Would you like your afternoon coffee, sir?\"\"\\n“Yes, yes. That would be wonderful. Also, I will take the hazard pay into consideration.\"\"\\n“Thank you, sir. I will be back in just a moment.\"\"\\n\\nAs the door closed, I couldn\\'t help but laugh to myself at her comment. She wanted hazard pay if she had to deal with the women in my life, and honestly, I didn\\'t blame her.\\n\\nAs the afternoon carried on, I found myself caught within my work. That was, until I started scrolling through my phone looking for a document and came across Becca\\'s photo again. Her beautiful figure and carefree smile… they captivated me.\\n\\nThe thought of boys at my house partying with my daughter and Becca didn\\'t sit well. I knew the girls were of age, but I didn\\'t like the idea that Becca may take an interest in one of those young men. Especially, since the way she acted around me meant she could want me. Oh god! What\\'s the matter with me? This girl has me all out of sorts.\\n\\n“Sir, your four o\\'clock appointment is calling to cancel?\"\" my secretary stated from my office door, pulling me from my thoughts.\\n\\n“That\\'s fine. I actually have an emergency that has come up, and I need to go home. See if you can get them to reschedule for me.\"\" \\n\\n“Of course, sir. Do you need anything else?\"\"\\n\\nMy eyes met hers briefly, but I did not say a word. It was enough for her to understand I was being serious and close the door, giving me time to think through what I was about to do.\\n\\n“Paul,\"\" I said into the receiver of my phone as I called my driver, “bring the car around.\"\"\\nIt was time to head home and see how the girls were doing. After all, what kind of responsible adult would I be if I didn\\'t?

I can’t do it by doing something constructive and positive because that takes time and actual work. I will get heaps of social media coverage if I just throw some disgusting comments out there to get a good reaction. Just like protesting at a soldier’s funeral to further traumatise family and outrage others or setting up some “god hates” banners somewhere near a school, where can those that need attention get it? How do I inflict maximum damage, get maximum shock and awe and gaslight Millions in one swoop? Maybe I should put up some signs out the front of the local adolescent psychiatric service to tell them their mental health needs are a drain on society. Just like a primary school bully looking to feel big and strong because they are suffering themselves, who’s an easy target for a scared little child that needs to feel good about themselves? Let’s pick the disabled kid, that’ll be easy!\\n\\nMr Night explained, “we saw the NDIS legislation attacked in previous years so that essential service levels and equipment could be stripped, and delegates could bypass any accountability via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\\n\\n“It appears our leaders prior to the change of Government thought too many people are challenging our poor decisions, so let's cut out their ability to question. It can't possibly be because we have got things wrong when we suggested the person with the permanent spinal injury should be cured by now and not need the funded support we decided to strip them of without warning or any sort of rationale.\\n\\n“What did some politicians use then to try and get those disgusting changes passed we see again this week? They suggest everyone on NDIS is using the funds for strippers and holidays to the Gold Coast. They seem to think, that will help them distract from their actual goals because most Australians won’t realise how absurd that is. Even when the NDIS was still under budget and rolling out, they cried wolf saying it was costing too much, hoping no one fact checked them. \\n\\n“There isn’t even a code to claim funds for sex workers in NDIS pricing. We are having trouble getting a new wheelchair approved for kids that is the right size most days, but yeah lets attack NDIS by suggesting the funds are being used for 500 000 participants to get special cuddles from a stranger.\\n\\n“When faced with the choice of having staff hours to shower you, dress you, and support you with essential daily living tasks, we can assure the Australian public that the weekly trip to the local brothel isn’t even on the horizon for the 4.4 million Australia’s living with disability. It is something many of those stuck on the Disability Support Pension, due to the employment bias, will need to save up for if they do want it.\\n\\n“Sex is of course a perfectly legal and normal part of an adult’s life but those living in the distance past still probably can’t cope with that idea, let alone sex when you have a disability! Of course, lets continue the narrative that sexuality and identity is off limits to people living with disability, aged care and of course how gross is it that our parents still kiss each other! Ewwww don’t talk about sex or recognise sexuality in any way no matter how aged appropriate and present in the lives of every Australian. Knowing how uncomfortable people are talking about sex, that’s a great way to distract and gas light our most vulnerable populations and sadly we see a few people use it as their fall-back script.\\n\\n“We the 4.4 million Australia’s living with disability are voters.

Bullies need to be seen as what they are; people behaving badly and usually needing support due to the difficulties they have in their own lives.

In the most important decision of his prime ministership and of his career, Anthony Albanese has finalised his proposed constitutional referendum for an Indigenous voice declaring his mission is to change this country.\\n\\nIt is a tragedy because the Australian Constitution needs to recognise the Indigenous people and what they rightly call the “torment of our powerlessness”, yet the Albanese cabinet decision is an extraordinary and flawed model devoid of bipartisanship or any effort to achieve it.\\n\\nThis referendum is a profound risk for Australia. It has been a long process but with extremely limited consultation with the public – no constitutional convention, no parliamentary committee collaborating on the model, no meaningful effort to strike bipartisanship, incredibly not even the release of legal advice from the Solicitor-General and then, on Thursday, the Prime Minister doubling down in a rejection of efforts to modify or temper the model whose flaws have been documented.\\n\\nIn his announcement Albanese endorsed a maximalist voice, thereby guaranteeing a fundamental change in Australia’s system of parliamentary and executive governance and making a contentious referendum even more contentious. Instead of putting qualifications on the voice Albanese went the other way – bowing before the Indigenous working group, he refused any meaningful change to the voice’s capacity to advise the executive government or address reported concerns of the Solicitor-General and Attorney-General.\\n\\nThis is no way to finalise a referendum question. The optics are disastrous – Albanese left the impression of a compliant prime minister submitting to Indigenous demands. There is no reason to change the recent assessment offered to the Sydney Institute by human rights lawyer and voice supporter Frank Brennan: “What’s proposed is too fixed, too simple, it won’t fly and I don’t think the Australian public would ever accept it.”\\n\\nFor Albanese, it is a personal mission. “I’m here to change the country,” he said. He wants to change the Constitution “to recognise the fullness of our history”. Magnificent vision. But beware prime ministers when they get emotional; it usually means a lurch into unreality.\\n\\nDo cabinet ministers understand what they signed off on Thursday morning? This is constitutionally empowered group rights tied to constitutionally empowered unlimited representations. It is unprecedented in a dual sense. If carried, it will change our governance and society. There is no way the Coalition could support this model and retain its integrity. It is a sad conclusion from Albanese’s latest remarks that he seeks to carry this referendum on a tactic of deception – relying on goodwill, emotions and the injustice Indigenous people have faced for so long.\\n\\nThis is an intellectual and moral deception. And that needs to be said now because if this referendum is defeated its origins will lie with the decisions Albanese announced on Thursday and the defeat will be his responsibility as the prime decision-maker.\\n\\nDon’t blame the Indigenous leaders. Having lacked political power for so long, when they saw a compliant prime minister they went for broke. The trouble is that Albanese has saddled himself with a model riddled with problems that guarantees a tactic of constant undermining by the No side.\\n\\nThe tragedy is that Albanese has conflated the just cause of Indigenous recognition with a model of the voice that breaches too many principles and runs too many risks to be supported.\\n\\nThe essence of this referendum is the insertion into the Constitution of a new institution with a vast constitutional ambit. It is a political institution designed to achieve a political purpose. There are numerous problems with the model but Labor essentially has chosen to ignore them and press ahead in a “crash through or crash” fatalism.\\n\\nIt is, frankly, incredible that since Albanese outlined his proposed referendum at the Garma Festival seven months ago there has been no public institutional process to examine and assess the proposal – just talk behind closed doors. This is an unacceptable foundation on which to ask the Australian people to endorse probably the most far-reaching referendum proposal since Federation.\\n\\nThis is an exceptionally rare referendum since it seeks to create a new chapter in the Australian Constitution. Albanese keeps up the pretence this is a “modest” proposal. That is false. There will be a new chapter nine in our Constitution that enshrines the voice. It will stand with earlier chapters dealing with the institutions of constitutional nationhood – parliament (chapter one), executive (chapter two), judiciary (chapter three) and so on.\\n\\nIt becomes a new advisory arm of government or what barrister Louise Clegg ventures to call “a fourth arm of government”.\\n\\nThe voice is an institution based on group or racial identity but empowered to make representations across the ambit of general laws and policymaking affecting the whole community since Indigenous people are part of the community. This is unprecedented in intent and scope.\\n\\nWe are told by Albanese this will unite the country. How does that work? If the Australian public understood what this institutional arrangement involved would they vote for it? That’s why Albanese’s campaign says the two issues are recognition and consultation. But that’s misleading. \\n\\nThere are thousands, probably millions, of people who support recognition and consultation but who will oppose the voice because they believe it is divisive or dangerous. Law professor Megan Davis, a member of the working group, told ABC radio the Prime Minister had listened to the working group. She said the voice “will have an extraordinary impact in terms of the government of the day and the parliament”. It would be proactive; it wouldn’t wait to be consulted. It is “a very, very powerful mechanism”. We should believe her.\\n\\nThe referendum is about power. The voice will make representations not just to parliament but the executive government including cabinet, ministers and public servants as decision-makers. The idea the voice has limited influence because it is advisory is disingenuous. It will function as a powerful political entity exerting enormous influence. That’s the entire purpose. It’s what the whole idea is about.\\n\\nThe constitutional amendment is open-ended and unlimited, such that the voice can make representations on virtually anything – from the conditions of Indigenous people to tax, social, economic, resources, cultural, defence and foreign policy.\\n\\nTrying to impose order on this open-ended constitutional power, Brennan urged the government to a surgical change – limiting or excluding its executive government advice in the Constitution, eliminating public servants from any constitutional ambit and letting the parliament take any such decisions.\\n\\nHe got nowhere. His effort trying to get a more viable, acceptable model was seen as counter-productive. Labor wants a voice with maximum interventionist scope, thereby inviting maximum resistance from the Coalition side of politics. This is smart politics? There is a fatalism at work here. Brennan argued that because the voice cannot possibly know about the multitude of decisions envisaged by hundreds of public servants affecting Indigenous people this would open the door to litigation, with the voice claiming it had been overlooked or muted. \\n\\nWhat is the government’s response? Incredibly, it is enunciation of a new principle, outlined by Albanese, that the parliament and executive government should seek “written advice from the voice early in the development of proposed laws and policies”.\\n\\nThe voice doesn’t just make representations. It needs to be told beforehand – confirmation that the voice will be integrated into the system of government and parliament, adding another layer of review, advice and complexity. How far does this extend? Will public servants be required to give notice to the voice every time they are going to make a decision that might affect an Aboriginal person? Will all this await clarification from the High Court?\\n\\nAlbanese is committed to ensuring the voice can make representations to the executive government but has failed to deliver a constitutional amendment that makes this workable. Brennan warns that the impact on the public service will be “somewhat equivalent to – though bigger than – the major commonwealth administrative law reforms that occurred in Australia in the 1970s”.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said people should support the referendum because we will “feel better” about ourselves. This is insulting and demeaning. It debases what this referendum is about and really says people don’t need to worry about what Albanese is proposing to do with our Constitution. The more he says this, the more he insults people. On every issue Albanese has deferred to the authority of the voice. This is surely an omen of the future – he has previously said it would be a brave government that ignored the advice of the voice. This underlines the sheer enormity of the political nature of this proposal.\\n\\nHow will the public respond? Clegg asked this question in her presentation to the recent Uphold and Recognise conference when she supported a far more modest model for the voice. Will ordinary Australians be impressed when voice members give doorstop TV interviews on parliamentary sitting days? Will they be impressed when there are public brawls over whether the voice has been properly consulted and listened to? Will they be impressed when there are deals done and horse-trading between voice members and federal parliamentarians?\\n\\nHow will advice from the voice stand with advice from the 11 Indigenous democratically elected members of the federal parliament? Who will have greater legitimacy and claim to be listened to?\\n\\nHow will the public service respond? Who in the executive government will get representations from the voice? The minister or the departmental head, or maybe a special unit created in every department and authority? What rules and processes will the public service follow after a representation from the voice arrives? Compliance in fear of retribution, or rejection with all the risks that involves?\\n\\nAlbanese would have made his political calculations. He believes, obviously, the voice will be carried. He must also believe the referendum will damage Peter Dutton’s standing and leadership though such damage probably depends on the voice being carried when Dutton opposes it. Finally, Albanese must think Australia has reached a turning point – that generational change means its historic aversion to supporting referendums is broken and the voice will constitute a new pathway in our political and constitutional life.\\n\\nThese are big calculations with big risks. This looms as a remarkable moment for Australia given our elites – the professional classes, corporate leaders and progressive opinion-makers – seem united in supporting the referendum, with Labor assuming they will put money behind it. That means corporate leaders need to be held to account and explain why they support such a radical change to our governance, constitutional principles and society in a referendum where the government refuses to even release the Solicitor-General’s advice surrounding its proposal.\\n\\nThis referendum will become the most critical test for many years of the character and leadership quality of those elites.\\n\\nThe federal Opposition Leader and his legal affairs spokesman, Julian Leeser, have called for the release of the Solicitor-General’s advice. This is essential in terms of transparency. It may support the model or it may not – but we need to see it. Labor had no problem releasing the Solicitor-General’s advice to attack Scott Morrison over the multiple ministries – but no appearance of the Solicitor-General’s advice on putting a new chapter into the Australian Constitution. Not important enough? What does that tell you about the Albanese government?\\n\\nThe government says the best legal minds in the country have been involved in devising the words. That’s good. The reality, however, is that the best legal minds in the country cannot stop issues arising from the voice being referred to the High Court.\\n\\nIt is true the voice cannot dictate outcomes of the parliament and executive from its representations.\\n\\nBut granting the voice the power to make representations to public servants means the voice needs to know that a public servant has considered the representation in making a decision. Failing that, the voice can seek judicial review of a flawed decision.\\n\\nAlbanese says he feels the weight of history and responsibility. He says Indigenous people have waited long enough and cannot wait any longer, that it is time to recognise 65,000 years of history and that this decision is “a matter from the heart”. All this is true.\\n\\nThe work done by Indigenous leaders over years on this project has been immense. There are many reasons to support the referendum ranging from historic injustice to establishing a mechanism to allow Indigenous people to be consulted and to make representations on issues that concern them. There is no problem with these sentiments or these principles.\\n\\nThe problem is the model of the voice being proposed, its extraordinary constitutional powers and their implications. It is fatuous to say those constitutional powers, once granted, will not be used. The case against the referendum lies in its essence – the institutional power it seeks to create. That is where the decision must be weighed and made. Albanese carries the final responsibility for that model –and he has failed that test.\"\\n\\nPaul Kelly\\nEditor-At-Large'}, {'label': 0, 'text': 'An unbelievebale speech about what has happened and where to from here.

Known for her works including Carpentaria, Tracker, The Swan Book.\\n\\nSpeakers:\\n\\n🕯️ Eulogy by Ms Wright delivered by her good friend, Djok voice actor, legal academic and legendary environmental leader Jacqui Katona, winner of the Goldman Environmental Prize for her work on the campaign to stop the Jabiluka uranium mine in Kakadu. Ms Katona is a founding member of the Melbourne School of Discontent, as well as the narrator of Alexis Wright’s The Swan Book audiobook among other works.\\n\\n🕯️ Greg Mullins, Former Commissioner, Fire and Rescue NSW; Climate Councillor and founder, Emergency Leaders for Climate Action. Greg warned Australia\\'s then–Prime Minister in April 2019 that a bushfire catastrophe was coming. He pleaded for support and was ignored, then risked his life dealing with the ramifications on the ground. “You couldn’t see very far because of the orange smoke. Everything was dark. It was probably 2 o’clock in the afternoon but it was like night. Then I saw something moving on the side of the road and I walked closer. It was a mob of kangaroos. The speed of that fire with its pyroconvective storm driving it in every direction, they had nowhere to go. They came out of the forest, on fire, and dropped dead on the road. I’ve never seen that. Kangaroos know what to do in a fire. They’re fast animals. Climate change, driven by the burning of coal, oil, and gas is driving worsening bushfires across Australia, and putting our precious, irreplaceable wildlife in danger.”\\n\\n🕯️ Internationally recognised ecologist and WWF board member, Professor Christopher Dickman oversaw the work calculating the animal deaths from Black Summer. A Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor Dickman already wore the heavy task of being an ecologist during the sixth mass extinction, in the country that has the worst rate of mammalian extinction in the world. On 8 January 2020 media around the world shared his finding that Black Summer fires had killed one billion animals. Sadly, the fires continued for two more months, and his team\\'s final count was three billion. This does not include invertebrates: it is estimated 240 trillion beetles, moths, spiders, yabbies and other invertebrates died in the fires.\\n\\n🕯️ Legendary wildlife veterinarian Dr Howard Ralph OAM coming up from Southern Cross Wildlife Hospital in the NSW Southern Tablelands.  As put by one of his clinic volunteers, \"If you were an animal suffering or dying, you would want to look up and see Howard looking down at you.” A qualified human doctor and anaesthetist as well as a veterinary surgeon, Dr Ralph\\'s reputation stands apart because where other vets would euthanise wildlife, he goes to great lengths to provide appropriate veterinary care to each individual he meets. From injured red belly black snakes, echidnas and wombats who\\'ve been hit by cars, kangaroos and ducks with gunshot wounds, to performing orthopaedic surgery on a microbat, a sparrow or an endangered giant burrowing frog, Dr Ralph is skilled in adapting equipment and techniques to save all those who live on these lands, and says, “It is frustrating that our wild native animals do not get the respect they deserve.\" In a weary interview given during the height of Black Summer, he said, \"The constant input of pain and suffering is tiring emotionally. We deal with that because it needs to be dealt with and the good news from my point of view is that we can do something about it.”\\n\\n🕯️ Coming up from the South Coast, owner of Wild2Free Kangaroo Sanctuary Rae Harvey, as seen in The Bond and The Fire. She is in the sad position of having personally known and cared for a number of Black Summer\\'s victims: many of the orphaned joeys she cared for were killed in the fires. (She nearly died herself too.) For three years, she has been unable to even speak their names. Now, for the first time, she will tell the story of the joeys she lost.\\n\\n🕯️  Cultural burning practitioner and Southern NSW Regional Coordinator with Firesticks Alliance, Djiringanj-Yuin Custodian Dan Morgan. Dan practises using Aboriginal knowledge to heal Country. He has worked for 18 years with the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service and is on the board of management for the Biamanga National Park, a sacred area home to the last surviving koalas on the NSW south coast – which was partly destroyed by the fires of Black Summer. “The animals that live on our sacred sites are our Ancestors, it\\'s our Cultural obligation to protect them. We have evolved with our Country over thousands of years, nourishing and protecting all living species. Our Country represents our people. So when the fires came, it was devastating to see the aftermath, and the feeling of helplessness was truly traumatising for our people, due to the denial of our Cultural right to manage Country as our Ancestors did for thousands of years prior to colonisation. Australia needs to make legislative changes that allow us to heal Country and our community through the fire knowledge and to stop incinerating ecosystems with destructive \\'hazard-reduction\\' burns.\"\\n\\n🕯️ Sonja Elwood, wildlife rescuer and rehabilitator of 35 years, and a founding member of the NSW Wildlife Council, which includes 26 wildlife groups representing over 4,000 volunteers in NSW. During Black Summer, Sonja worked with animal rescue organisations and local carers to establish emergency triage centres for wildlife on the South Coast. \"I was working alongside wildlife carers who had lost their homes and whose animals had been lost in the fires. Others had been evacuated and didn\\'t know if they had a house to go back to anymore. They would have had every right to just collapse in despair and they didn\\'t. They said, what can I do; how can I help; put me on the roster; when do you want me tomorrow? They showed up every day to help our burnt wildlife.\"\\n\\n🕯️ Head of Programs & Disaster Response at Humane Society International (HSI), Evan Quartermain was one of the first responders on Kangaroo Island where nearly 40% of the island burnt at high severity: “Those were some of the toughest scenes I’d ever witnessed as an animal rescuer: the bodies of charred animals as far as the eye can see. Every time we found an animal alive it felt like a miracle.” As a result of this firsthand experience, HSI commissioned a report into the state of Australia\\'s disaster response for wildlife, which we\\'ll also hear about.\\n\\n🕯️ Danielle Celermajer, Deputy Director of the Sydney Environment Institute and leader of the Multispecies Justice project. In the midst of the fires, Danielle started to write about a new crime of our age – omnicide, the killing of all. Her book Summertime narrates her firsthand experience of what catastrophic climate change feels like and means not only for humans, but for the animals whose worlds it is ruining. She will share the story of Jimmy and Katy, left to die as piglets on a factory farm floor, who’d been living safely on the land they shared with the rest of the multispecies community until Black Summer.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Black Summer Vigil is brought to you by the Department of Animals, Animals Australia, the NSW Wildlife Council, World Animal Protection, Humane Society International and Defend the Wild, with support from WIRES, Firesticks Alliance, Nature Conservation Council of NSW, Wild2Free Kangaroo Rescue, Four Paws, Friends of the Koala and Kangaroos Alive.'}, {'label': 0, 'text': 'Wife Helps Her Husband After Officers Mistake!\\nLike the page for more videos! 👍'}, {'label': 1, 'text': '📢Today the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Bill was introduced into Federal Parliament.

Ms Katona is a founding member of the Melbourne School of Discontent, as well as the narrator of Alexis Wright’s The Swan Book audiobook among other works.\\n\\n🕯️ Greg Mullins, Former Commissioner, Fire and Rescue NSW; Climate Councillor and founder, Emergency Leaders for Climate Action. Greg warned Australia\\'s then–Prime Minister in April 2019 that a bushfire catastrophe was coming. He pleaded for support and was ignored, then risked his life dealing with the ramifications on the ground. “You couldn’t see very far because of the orange smoke. Everything was dark. It was probably 2 o’clock in the afternoon but it was like night. Then I saw something moving on the side of the road and I walked closer. It was a mob of kangaroos. The speed of that fire with its pyroconvective storm driving it in every direction, they had nowhere to go. They came out of the forest, on fire, and dropped dead on the road. I’ve never seen that. Kangaroos know what to do in a fire. They’re fast animals. Climate change, driven by the burning of coal, oil, and gas is driving worsening bushfires across Australia, and putting our precious, irreplaceable wildlife in danger.”\\n\\n🕯️ Internationally recognised ecologist and WWF board member, Professor Christopher Dickman oversaw the work calculating the animal deaths from Black Summer. A Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor Dickman already wore the heavy task of being an ecologist during the sixth mass extinction, in the country that has the worst rate of mammalian extinction in the world. On 8 January 2020 media around the world shared his finding that Black Summer fires had killed one billion animals. Sadly, the fires continued for two more months, and his team\\'s final count was three billion. This does not include invertebrates: it is estimated 240 trillion beetles, moths, spiders, yabbies and other invertebrates died in the fires.\\n\\n🕯️ Legendary wildlife veterinarian Dr Howard Ralph OAM coming up from Southern Cross Wildlife Hospital in the NSW Southern Tablelands.  As put by one of his clinic volunteers, \"If you were an animal suffering or dying, you would want to look up and see Howard looking down at you.” A qualified human doctor and anaesthetist as well as a veterinary surgeon, Dr Ralph\\'s reputation stands apart because where other vets would euthanise wildlife, he goes to great lengths to provide appropriate veterinary care to each individual he meets. From injured red belly black snakes, echidnas and wombats who\\'ve been hit by cars, kangaroos and ducks with gunshot wounds, to performing orthopaedic surgery on a microbat, a sparrow or an endangered giant burrowing frog, Dr Ralph is skilled in adapting equipment and techniques to save all those who live on these lands, and says, “It is frustrating that our wild native animals do not get the respect they deserve.\" In a weary interview given during the height of Black Summer, he said, \"The constant input of pain and suffering is tiring emotionally. We deal with that because it needs to be dealt with and the good news from my point of view is that we can do something about it.”\\n\\n🕯️ Coming up from the South Coast, owner of Wild2Free Kangaroo Sanctuary Rae Harvey, as seen in The Bond and The Fire. She is in the sad position of having personally known and cared for a number of Black Summer\\'s victims: many of the orphaned joeys she cared for were killed in the fires. (She nearly died herself too.) For three years, she has been unable to even speak their names. Now, for the first time, she will tell the story of the joeys she lost.\\n\\n🕯️  Cultural burning practitioner and Southern NSW Regional Coordinator with Firesticks Alliance, Djiringanj-Yuin Custodian Dan Morgan. Dan practises using Aboriginal knowledge to heal Country. He has worked for 18 years with the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service and is on the board of management for the Biamanga National Park, a sacred area home to the last surviving koalas on the NSW south coast – which was partly destroyed by the fires of Black Summer. “The animals that live on our sacred sites are our Ancestors, it\\'s our Cultural obligation to protect them. We have evolved with our Country over thousands of years, nourishing and protecting all living species. Our Country represents our people. So when the fires came, it was devastating to see the aftermath, and the feeling of helplessness was truly traumatising for our people, due to the denial of our Cultural right to manage Country as our Ancestors did for thousands of years prior to colonisation. Australia needs to make legislative changes that allow us to heal Country and our community through the fire knowledge and to stop incinerating ecosystems with destructive \\'hazard-reduction\\' burns.\"\\n\\n🕯️ Sonja Elwood, wildlife rescuer and rehabilitator of 35 years, and a founding member of the NSW Wildlife Council, which includes 26 wildlife groups representing over 4,000 volunteers in NSW. During Black Summer, Sonja worked with animal rescue organisations and local carers to establish emergency triage centres for wildlife on the South Coast. \"I was working alongside wildlife carers who had lost their homes and whose animals had been lost in the fires. Others had been evacuated and didn\\'t know if they had a house to go back to anymore. They would have had every right to just collapse in despair and they didn\\'t. They said, what can I do; how can I help; put me on the roster; when do you want me tomorrow? They showed up every day to help our burnt wildlife.\"\\n\\n🕯️ Head of Programs & Disaster Response at Humane Society International (HSI), Evan Quartermain was one of the first responders on Kangaroo Island where nearly 40% of the island burnt at high severity: “Those were some of the toughest scenes I’d ever witnessed as an animal rescuer: the bodies of charred animals as far as the eye can see. Every time we found an animal alive it felt like a miracle.” As a result of this firsthand experience, HSI commissioned a report into the state of Australia\\'s disaster response for wildlife, which we\\'ll also hear about.\\n\\n🕯️ Danielle Celermajer, Deputy Director of the Sydney Environment Institute and leader of the Multispecies Justice project. In the midst of the fires, Danielle started to write about a new crime of our age – omnicide, the killing of all. Her book Summertime narrates her firsthand experience of what catastrophic climate change feels like and means not only for humans, but for the animals whose worlds it is ruining. She will share the story of Jimmy and Katy, left to die as piglets on a factory farm floor, who’d been living safely on the land they shared with the rest of the multispecies community until Black Summer.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Black Summer Vigil is brought to you by the Department of Animals, Animals Australia, the NSW Wildlife Council, World Animal Protection, Humane Society International and Defend the Wild, with support from WIRES, Firesticks Alliance, Nature Conservation Council of NSW, Wild2Free Kangaroo Rescue, Four Paws, Friends of the Koala and Kangaroos Alive.'}, {'label': 1, 'text': '🇦🇺WE ARE ONE🇦🇺\\n\\nThrough the week Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price invited delegates from across our great country to have their voices heard in Parliament.\\n\\nTheir one common view was opposing any change to our Constitution, which will only create a divide based on race.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not come and listen to these people, the very same people he claims he wants to give a voice to.\\n\\nI stand with Jacinta against adding another layer of bureaucracy, and will vote NO to the Voice to Parliament!\\n\\n#weareone #🇦🇺❤️'}, {'label': 1, 'text': \"Good morning!

In a hung parliament, the major parties need to work with Independents, to negotiate and collaborate to pass legislation which, in turn, gives Independents a significant voice in how legislation is shaped.\\n\\nWhen I get asked the wasted-vote question, I often ask people to explain what their last vote, their non-Independent vote, got them.\\n\\nIn Coffs Harbour, we have overcrowded schools with no indication from the current government that any new schools are in the pipeline until all other avenues (demountables, enforcing catchments, shuffling students) have been exhausted. We have a teacher crisis that has half the workforce thinking of quitting. A social and affordable housing crisis that has been a decade in the making and a \"solution\" that delivers fewer bedrooms to the needy and more profits to developers. A coastal lake that has been ranked amongst the worst in the world from poorly regulated agricultural practices, with little investigation and little in the way of real sanctions. A government that wants to sell off part of the Jetty Foreshores for private residential development despite the wishes of the overwhelming majority of locals.\\n\\nThese are the issues I have talked with locals over the years and most particularly over the last few weeks. And in hearing these questions, the only conclusion, the only logical conclusion, is that the current government isn\\'t listening or simply doesn\\'t care.\\n\\nAnd if that\\'s not a wasted vote, what is?'}, {'label': 0, 'text': \"CME DIVERSITY & INCLUSION REPORT\\n\\nCME’s Diversity & Inclusion Report highlights the importance of diversity and inclusivity in the mining & resources industry of WA.\\n\\nRio Tinto's RioInspire is a globally recognised program that develops executive-ready future leaders from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.\\n\\n“This course has helped us … build confidence in our abilities and start to strongly consider pathways to become one of those senior leaders with a voice at the table.”\\n\\nRead the Report here: https://bit.ly/3JjF0Bl\"}, {'label': 1, 'text': \"A vote in parliament, then a people's vote.

Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male’s interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let’s be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6’am? Close to Nil.\\n\\nIt was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.\\n\\n“This is working out.” My vice governor cheered.\\n\\n“Yeah,” I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.\\n\\n11:30 am.\\n\\n‘dang!’ I cursed under my breath, “This meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.” I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, “Of course.”\\n\\nHe addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.\\n\\nThe room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.\\n\\nThe noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.\\n\\n“Is there a problem Laura?” I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.\\n\\nHer dark brows knitting, she turned to me, “Sir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.”\\n\\nI arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, “Can it wait till I’m done at Kota?”\\n\\nShe shook her head, “No sir. It can’t. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.”\\n\\n“Fine, out with it.” Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.\\n\\nShe glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, “Sir…You can’t be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the…”\\n\\nThe rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that darned organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.\\n\\nWife.\\n\\nThe word left a bitter taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.\\n\\nA wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.\\n\\n“Why don’t we discuss this at the next meeting?”\\n\\nLaura’s eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, “The primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.”\\n\\n“But I thought Mr. Dakota was married?” an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.\\n\\n“If you all don’t know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don’t know what the heck you are doing in here campaigning for him!” she snapped.\\n\\n“As Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.” I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.\\n\\nMy jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.\\n\\n“Please wait, hold the elevator.”\\n\\nI lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.\\n\\nMy annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThe single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.\\n\\nAll thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.\\n\\nHer golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she’d look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.\\n\\nSuddenly she reached for her camera.\\n\\nA Reporter.\\n\\nI inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I’d figured, they were nothing but trouble.\\n\\nStriding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nKimberly Scott’s P.O.V\\n\\nSavage and fierce.\\n\\nDevastatingly sexy.\\n\\nHis heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!\\n\\nI snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.\\n\\nJoey Dakota.\\n\\nCEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People’s Party.\\n\\nA hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.\\n\\nHow atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.\\n\\nJoey Dakota is no different.\\n\\nAfter his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics—aka stealing from the public.\\n\\nIt was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‘Serial heartbreaker.’\\n\\nHe had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.\\n\\nImpulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‘clicking’ sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.\\n\\n“Hey!” I rush at him, “What do you think you’re doing? You can’t do that!”\\n\\nBut he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.\\n\\nThat could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.\\n\\nI bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, “HOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.”\\n\\nIt was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.\\n\\nHe removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.\\n\\n“Weren’t you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent?  reporters.” he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.\\n\\n“I’m not a reporter. And weren’t you taught how to be courteous to strangers?” I retorted, “I guess not. Your mother wasn’t there to teach you manners.”\\n\\nI watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ‘Oh dang!’ I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.\\n\\nI quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‘Ding’ and I felt my heart plop into my belly.\\n\\nHe turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, “What did you just say?”\\n\\nHis voice could cut glass.\\n\\nCelebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything…maybe …. Murder?\\n\\n“Nothing,” I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.\\n\\nI slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me—a good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.\\n\\nA cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.\\n\\nThe slap never came.\\n\\nCracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, “You thought I was going to hit you?” his voice was quiet. “Why?”\\n\\nI held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.\\n\\nI stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn’t tell him or anyone at all.\\n\\nI was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.\\n\\nI shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.\\n\\n“I would never hit a woman,” he mused softly, “I only broke the stupid storage card.”\\n\\n“YOU DID WHAT?” I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.\\n\\nAngry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.\\n\\nThat card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.\\n\\nAn image of a woman’s pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt was my only hope in paying for my mother’s hospital bills.\\n\\nOne would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.\\n\\nLife had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.\\n\\nNeither of us expected the stage four bare cancer that took over my mother’s previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.\\n\\nShe got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.\\n\\nI rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.\\n\\nJust as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.\\n\\nMy knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.\\n\\nI felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.\\n\\nHis arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn’t be this trembling mess in his arms.\\n\\n“Hey, Hey…” He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, “Are you okay?”\\n\\nI could hear the blood passing through my ears—thump, thump, thump—and saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.\\n\\nI fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.\\n\\n“Are you claustrophobic?” now that he wasn’t holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.\\n\\nI nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn’t see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since… I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.\\n\\nI fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.\\n\\nSuddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, “You are having a panic attack Miss…” he trailed off and I croaked, “Kim... Call me Kim.”\\n\\n“I need you to focus on the sound of my voice,” His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.\\n\\n“Breath Kim,” he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.\\n\\nI tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.\\n\\n“You are dying.” A voice in my head said, “This was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.”\\n\\nAs if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, “You are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim…Breath.”\\n\\nHis voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.\\n\\nMy palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.\\n\\nI felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, “We are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.”\\n\\nMy breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.\\n\\nSoon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn’t make any sense of the one-sided conversation.\\n\\nHe shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, “is it better now?”\\n\\n“Yes…thank you.” A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.\\n\\nNow that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn’t matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.\\n\\nSuddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\nMy eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.\\n\\ndang!\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nJoey’s P.O.V\\n\\nWhy the screw did they come here?\\n\\nI jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.\\n\\nAs if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.\\n\\nThe doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.\\n\\n reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.\\n\\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn’t felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.\\n\\nA ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.\\n\\nI’m surprised the spit-fire hasn’t threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I’ve been staring at her.\\n\\nThe elevator doors pinged.\\n\\nThe top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.\\n\\nWaving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim’s hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, “Don’t worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.”\\n\\nShe shook her head, “Give me one reason I shouldn’t head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!”\\n\\nTaken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, “What?”\\n\\n“You destroyed my  storage card.” Her eyes shone, “It had everything in it. Everything!”\\n\\nShe enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.\\n\\n“We are kind of in the middle of something,” I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.\\n\\nThankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.\\n\\nLaurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.\\n\\n“What is going on here?” My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, “You didn’t brief me that a conference might be held.”\\n\\n“Nah, that’s not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.”\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nSomehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.\\n\\nTheir voices yelled over each other.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, “As you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.” His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.\\n\\nI felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.\\n\\nClearly, this wasn’t her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since…I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.\\n\\n“Let me take it from here,” I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.\\n\\nAll eyes riveted on me, “As Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,” there was a low chorus of laughter, “and there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.”\\n\\n“Who is she?” Came from the throng.\\n\\nTightening my hold on Kim’s trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.\\n\\nRipping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, “I can’t imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.” Her voice was breathless.\\n\\nA smile tipped the side of my face, “It gets better with time.”\\n\\nShe snapped her head up and glared at me, “How does THAT get any better?” her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.\\n\\nI walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.\\n\\nI handed her one and took a sip from mine, “Because you get used to it.”\\n\\nShe gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.\\n\\nA hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank  God.\\n\\nI just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.\\n\\nMy jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I  missed the meeting.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.\\n\\nShe jolted as she saw me standing by the door, “Sir? I thought you left.”\\n\\nI shook my head, “The elevator broke down.”\\n\\nIt wouldn’t be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.\\n\\nShe nodded slowly in understanding.\\n\\n“You had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I’d lose that one.” She glanced at a note in her hand.\\n\\nI scowled, staring down at my ex-wife’s name scribbled on the paper, “Anything important?\\n\\n“The usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.”\\n\\nI crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.\\n\\nThen changing the topic, she pointed at the door, “They finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.”\\n\\n“Yeah,” I murmured distractedly.\\n\\nI reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, “Kimberly Scott?”\\n\\nI had momentarily forgotten that I wasn’t alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura’s wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.\\n\\n“Yeah…” Kim replied hesitantly, “That’s me.”\\n\\n“Oh my God,” Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, “I am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.”\\n\\nLegend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?\\n\\nA loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.\\n\\n“You must give me an autograph,” Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, “This is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.”\\n\\nThe latter it is then.\\n\\nKim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.\\n\\nA few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‘I hadn’t been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.\\n\\nShe took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, “Thank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?”\\n\\nShe nodded, somewhat embarrassed, “Of course, you can.”\\n\\nLaura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, “Uh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.”\\n\\nShe was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.\\n\\nHelping her out of her misery, I cut in, “You never told me you were such a big shot,” I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.\\n\\nBut her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, “Yeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‘big shot.’ Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.”\\n\\nI didn’t hear a word she said.\\n\\nHer eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, “Do you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?” I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.\\n\\nOur eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.\\n\\nLaura immediately chipped in, “Kim, you haven’t published a photo since the last one. Why…?” she trailed off.\\n\\nKim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, “I have other things taking my time now.” Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, “It was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.”\\n\\n“My pleasure,” I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.\\n\\nAt her exit, Laura sighed, “you must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‘an angel.”\\n\\n“And what did the media term me as, “Devil?” I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, “They would be right if they did.”\\n\\nI snorted.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.\\n\\n“What is it?” Narrowing my eyes, I asked, “I know that look, Laura.”\\n\\n“I think I might know what we have to do to get you a bride before the primaries.”\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"\\nAGAINST HER WILL”🤩🤩 👉Click to Read more about📜<AGAINST HER WILL>📜 land.novelenders.com'}, {'label': 0, 'text': \"Hi - I'm Hilary van Haren, the Greens Candidate for Gosford greens.org.au\"}, {'label': 0, 'text': \"⏱💰 Can you spare a minute to help get Drouin and Warragul Arterial Road Network Planning on the State Government’s agenda?\\n \\n⌛️ The State Government are in the final weeks of deciding their spending priorities for this year’s state budget.

It can be hard to get recognition for the gazillion things we juggle each day, and the millions of tiny acts of care we display for the people close to us. Self care can take a backseat when there are so many people around us relying on us to be the strong one in their lives.\\n\\nIt’s hard to be seen as strong when our strength so often lies under the surface. It can be hard for people to recognise our strength when so often it’s invisible. And women ARE strong. Yes, all of us. \\n\\nSo this International Women’s Day, I’d like you to consider celebrating other women who just as empowered as you are. And I’d like you to consider stepping back for a second and recognising your own strength. Because it’s there, whether you pause long enough to recognise it or not. \\n\\nIf you’re reading this, I’d like you to remember your worth — as a woman and as a contributing member of society. \\n\\nI’d encourage you to tell other women you know that you see them, and you see their strength shining through.\\n\\nAnd I’d like you to consider how strong you personally are. How you’ve made it through 100% of your toughest days on this planet and you’re still going. \\n\\nCelebrate your inner strength, and celebrate the strength of the women around you. \\n\\nWe all deserve recognition, and if your recognition comes from within, it’s just as valid. \\n\\nBe the voice of reason you craved when you were younger. And be the voice for the next generation too, if you ever get the privilege. \\n\\nHold onto your strength and draw upon it when you need it the most. \\n\\nEven if no one but you knows your personal journey, keep going. Travel through this life of ours, and remember: you are worth it. You’re worth the time. You’re worth the recognition. You’re worth the acceptance. And you’re worth celebrating your own story.\\n\\nYou are a woman. It’s time for you to shine — today, and always. \\n\\nHappy International Women’s Day 2023 — you’ve got this!\\n\\n#IWD2023 #embraceequity #celebrateyourself #youarestrong #keepgoing #keepshining #youvegotthis Written By Chanee Hi everyone, this page was designed to link to my Instagram account so that I can share my posts directly to Facebook.

If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,” the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, “Then LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.”\\n\\n“LPP!” Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, “Liberalism to all!”\\n\\nHe was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.\\n\\n“You all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,” I slapped the secretary on his back, “Congratulations to us all.”\\n\\nStanding at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people’s party and run for the governorship of Florida.\\n\\nThe idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‘a notorious playboy’.\\n\\nSecond, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn’t count as an experience.\\n\\nAt the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don’t know who was more shocked, myself or the public.\\n\\nBut somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.\\n\\nWhen I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male’s interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let’s be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6’am? Close to Nil.\\n\\nIt was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.\\n\\n“This is working out.” My vice governor cheered.\\n\\n“Yeah,” I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.\\n\\n11:30 am.\\n\\n‘’ I cursed under my breath, “This meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.” I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, “Of course.”\\n\\nHe addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.\\n\\nThe room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.\\n\\nThe noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.\\n\\n“Is there a problem Laura?” I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.\\n\\nHer dark brows knitting, she turned to me, “Sir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.”\\n\\nI arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, “Can it wait till I’m done at Kota?”\\n\\nShe shook her head, “No sir. It can’t. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.”\\n\\n“Fine, out with it.” Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.\\n\\nShe glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, “Sir…You can’t be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the…”\\n\\nThe rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.\\n\\nWife.\\n\\nThe word left a bitter taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.\\n\\nA wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.\\n\\n“Why don’t we discuss this at the next meeting?”\\n\\nLaura’s eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, “The primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.”\\n\\n“But I thought Mr. Dakota was married?” an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.\\n\\n“If you all don’t know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don’t know what the hell you are doing in here campaigning for him!” she snapped.\\n\\n“As Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.” I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.\\n\\nMy jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.\\n\\n“Please wait, hold the elevator.”\\n\\nI lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.\\n\\nMy annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThe single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.\\n\\nAll thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.\\n\\nHer golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she’d look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.\\n\\nSuddenly she reached for her camera.\\n\\nA Reporter.\\n\\nI inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I’d figured, they were nothing but trouble.\\n\\nStriding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nKimberly Scott’s P.O.V\\n\\nSavage and fierce.\\n\\nDevastatingly sexy.\\n\\nHis heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!\\n\\nI snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.\\n\\nJoey Dakota.\\n\\nCEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People’s Party.\\n\\nA hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.\\n\\nHow atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.\\n\\nJoey Dakota is no different.\\n\\nAfter his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics—aka stealing from the public.\\n\\nIt was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‘Serial heartbreaker.’\\n\\nHe had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.\\n\\nImpulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‘clicking’ sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.\\n\\n“Hey!” I rush at him, “What do you think you’re doing? You can’t do that!”\\n\\nBut he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.\\n\\nThat could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.\\n\\nI bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, “HOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.”\\n\\nIt was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.\\n\\nHe removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.\\n\\n“Weren’t you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent? F* reporters.” he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.\\n\\n“I’m not a reporter. And weren’t you taught how to be courteous to strangers?” I retorted, “I guess not. Your mother wasn’t there to teach you manners.”\\n\\nI watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ’ I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.\\n\\nI quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‘Ding’ and I felt my heart plop into my belly.\\n\\nHe turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, “What did you just say?”\\n\\nHis voice could cut glass.\\n\\nCelebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything…maybe …. Murder?\\n\\n“Nothing,” I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.\\n\\nI slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me—a good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.\\n\\nA cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.\\n\\nThe slap never came.\\n\\nCracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, “You thought I was going to hit you?” his voice was quiet. “Why?”\\n\\nI held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.\\n\\nI stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn’t tell him or anyone at all.\\n\\nI was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.\\n\\nI shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.\\n\\n“I would never hit a woman,” he mused softly, “I only broke the stupid storage card.”\\n\\n“YOU DID WHAT?” I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.\\n\\nAngry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.\\n\\nThat card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.\\n\\nAn image of a woman’s pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt was my only hope in paying for my mother’s hospital bills.\\n\\nOne would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.\\n\\nLife had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.\\n\\nNeither of us expected the stage four breast cancer that took over my mother’s previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.\\n\\nShe got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.\\n\\nI rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.\\n\\nJust as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.\\n\\nMy knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.\\n\\nI felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.\\n\\nHis arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn’t be this trembling mess in his arms.\\n\\n“Hey, Hey…” He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, “Are you okay?”\\n\\nI could hear the blood passing through my ears—thump, thump, thump—and saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.\\n\\nI fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.\\n\\n“Are you claustrophobic?” now that he wasn’t holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.\\n\\nI nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn’t see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since… I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.\\n\\nI fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.\\n\\nSuddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, “You are having a panic attack Miss…” he trailed off and I croaked, “Kim... Call me Kim.”\\n\\n“I need you to focus on the sound of my voice,” His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.\\n\\n“Breath Kim,” he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.\\n\\nI tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.\\n\\n“You are dying.” A voice in my head said, “This was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.”\\n\\nAs if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, “You are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim…Breath.”\\n\\nHis voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.\\n\\nMy palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.\\n\\nI felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, “We are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.”\\n\\nMy breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.\\n\\nSoon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn’t make any sense of the one-sided conversation.\\n\\nHe shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, “is it better now?”\\n\\n“Yes…thank you.” A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.\\n\\nNow that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn’t matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.\\n\\nSuddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\nMy eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nJoey’s P.O.V\\n\\nWhy the* did they come here?\\n\\nI jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.\\n\\nAs if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.\\n\\nThe doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.\\n\\n*ing reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.\\n\\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn’t felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.\\n\\nA ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.\\n\\nI’m surprised the spit-fire hasn’t threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I’ve been staring at her.\\n\\nThe elevator doors pinged.\\n\\nThe top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.\\n\\nWaving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim’s hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, “Don’t worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.”\\n\\nShe shook her head, “Give me one reason I shouldn’t head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!”\\n\\nTaken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, “What?”\\n\\n“You destroyed my* storage card.” Her eyes shone, “It had everything in it. Everything!”\\n\\nShe enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.\\n\\n“We are kind of in the middle of something,” I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.\\n\\nThankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.\\n\\nLaurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.\\n\\n“What is going on here?” My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, “You didn’t brief me that a conference might be held.”\\n\\n“Nah, that’s not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.”\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nSomehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.\\n\\nTheir voices yelled over each other.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, “As you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.” His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.\\n\\nI felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.\\n\\nClearly, this wasn’t her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since…I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.\\n\\n“Let me take it from here,” I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.\\n\\nAll eyes riveted on me, “As Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,” there was a low chorus of laughter, “and there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.”\\n\\n“Who is she?” Came from the throng.\\n\\nTightening my hold on Kim’s trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.\\n\\nRipping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, “I can’t imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.” Her voice was breathless.\\n\\nA smile tipped the side of my face, “It gets better with time.”\\n\\nShe snapped her head up and glared at me, “How does THAT get any better?” her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.\\n\\nI walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.\\n\\nI handed her one and took a sip from mine, “Because you get used to it.”\\n\\nShe gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.\\n\\nA hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank*g God.\\n\\nI just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.\\n\\nMy jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I * missed the meeting.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.\\n\\nShe jolted as she saw me standing by the door, “Sir? I thought you left.”\\n\\nI shook my head, “The elevator broke down.”\\n\\nIt wouldn’t be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.\\n\\nShe nodded slowly in understanding.\\n\\n“You had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I’d lose that one.” She glanced at a note in her hand.\\n\\nI scowled, staring down at my ex-wife’s name scribbled on the paper, “Anything important?\\n\\n“The usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.”\\n\\nI crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.\\n\\nThen changing the topic, she pointed at the door, “They finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.”\\n\\n“Yeah,” I murmured distractedly.\\n\\nI reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, “Kimberly Scott?”\\n\\nI had momentarily forgotten that I wasn’t alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura’s wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.\\n\\n“Yeah…” Kim replied hesitantly, “That’s me.”\\n\\n“Oh my God,” Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, “I am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.”\\n\\nLegend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?\\n\\nA loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.\\n\\n“You must give me an autograph,” Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, “This is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.”\\n\\nThe latter it is then.\\n\\nKim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.\\n\\nA few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‘I hadn’t been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.\\n\\nShe took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, “Thank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?”\\n\\nShe nodded, somewhat embarrassed, “Of course, you can.”\\n\\nLaura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, “Uh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.”\\n\\nShe was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.\\n\\nHelping her out of her misery, I cut in, “You never told me you were such a big shot,” I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.\\n\\nBut her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, “Yeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‘big shot.’ Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.”\\n\\nI didn’t hear a word she said.\\n\\nHer eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, “Do you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?” I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.\\n\\nOur eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.\\n\\nLaura immediately chipped in, “Kim, you haven’t published a photo since the last one. Why…?” she trailed off.\\n\\nKim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, “I have other things taking my time now.” Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, “It was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.”\\n\\n“My pleasure,” I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.\\n\\nAt her exit, Laura sighed, “you must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‘an angel.”\\n\\n“And what did the media term me as, “Devil?” I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, “They would be right if they did.”\\n\\nI snorted.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.\\n\\n“What is it?” Narrowing my eyes, I asked, “I know that look, Laura.” Click to Read more about📜<AGAINST HER WILL>📜 www.readfreeapp.com'}, {'label': 0, 'text': 'Do you know that globally, over 300 million Christians face persecution, jail and even death?\\n\\nFor over 50 years, Voice of the Martyrs has supported as many as possible with practical and spiritual support, standing alongside persecuted pastors, evangelists, Christian workers and their families when needed most.\\n\\nHelp The Millions Of Christians Who Face Persecution Every Day.

If we keep at this campaign with the same zeal and hard work,” the party secretary, Mac flashed a huge grin at all the party executives, his warm eyes coming to rest on mine, “Then LPP is surely producing the next governor of Florida.”\\n\\n“LPP!” Laurence, the party chairman yelled, his expression enthusiastic and the other party members chorused, “Liberalism to all!”\\n\\nHe was a graying heavyset man with bland brown eyes protected by wire-rimmed glasses.\\n\\n“You all have done a great job, contributing your Quota with utmost passion,” I slapped the secretary on his back, “Congratulations to us all.”\\n\\nStanding at the head of the conference table, I felt peace wash through me. These past few months had been hectic and I blame it on none other than my close friend. He insisted that I take the offer from the Party chairman of the liberal people’s party and run for the governorship of Florida.\\n\\nThe idea had seemed superfluous at the time because I was the CEO of a cosmetic company, a self-made billionaire, and quoting the media, ‘a notorious playboy’.\\n\\nSecond, I had no real political experience asides from the fact that my grandfather was the Mayor of Florida which doesn’t count as an experience.\\n\\nAt the mention of my name during the public announcement of political aspirants and candidates, I don’t know who was more shocked, myself or the public.\\n\\nBut somehow, I find myself thinking of the many things I would achieve as governor of Florida, and the ease I would create for every Floridian.\\n\\nWhen I was first approached by the Party Chairman, my company was just about to launch its first Male-oriented beauty product. Being a sociologist by profession, I knew it going to be tough diverting a Macho Male’s interest into making use of a self-tanner or tropical-scented bath soap that cost 20$ per ounce. Let’s be honest with ourselves, how many males would apply a toner before grabbing a cup of coffee by 6’am? Close to Nil.\\n\\nIt was a project doomed for failure from its very start. But with the perfect market researcher I hired, Kota Toner has an engagement of widely twenty million men and still counting.\\n\\n“This is working out.” My vice governor cheered.\\n\\n“Yeah,” I clipped, my eyes flickering to my wrist.\\n\\n11:30 am.\\n\\n‘’ I cursed under my breath, “This meeting would have to be wrapped up, I need to be elsewhere.” I said to Laurence who gave a tight nod, “Of course.”\\n\\nHe addressed the party members and executives for a few minutes and then called the meeting to an end. It was fruitful, I reflected with a faint smile but I had to be at Kota Cosmetics in twenty minutes. I hate to break my impeccable record of being punctual to business meetings. It was difficult merging the corporate world with politics.\\n\\nThe room broke out in mild chaos as the members rose to their feet. Chairs scrapped along the tiled floors, briefcases clattered noisily against chairs.\\n\\nThe noise and rowdiness died at the shrill sound my assistant emitted.\\n\\n“Is there a problem Laura?” I asked softly, realizing that she had been silent throughout the unusual meeting.\\n\\nHer dark brows knitting, she turned to me, “Sir, I hate to be a party pooper but there is a big problem.”\\n\\nI arched a brow, my gaze flickering to my wristwatch again, “Can it wait till I’m done at Kota?”\\n\\nShe shook her head, “No sir. It can’t. The success of this entire campaign depends on it.”\\n\\n“Fine, out with it.” Laurence cut in with a snappish tone.\\n\\nShe glanced furtively at me, nibbling on her bottom lip, “Sir…You can’t be governor without a wife. It is a law in the constitution of Florida, a supporter just left a comment in the comment section for the…”\\n\\nThe rest of her words faded into quietness as a crude, cutting pain sliced into that organ in my ribcage that refused to heal.\\n\\nWife.\\n\\nThe word left a bitter taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI got married to my job a long time before I met Carly so it was fairly my fault that our marriage ended as a total disaster.\\n\\nA wave of nausea flushed through me and I clenched my jaw, fighting the anger that bubbled in my lungs.\\n\\n“Why don’t we discuss this at the next meeting?”\\n\\nLaura’s eyes narrowed to pinpoints as she turned to look at the speaker, “The primary election is in three days. Mr. Dakota has to fall in love and be married before the day ends tomorrow or I am sorry, there would be no election.”\\n\\n“But I thought Mr. Dakota was married?” an anonymous voice chipped from the back and she groaned.\\n\\n“If you all don’t know that he was divorced four years ago, then I don’t know what the hell you are doing in here campaigning for him!” she snapped.\\n\\n“As Mac had said, it would be discussed next at the Party Meeting.” I turned around and walked away from the conference room abruptly.\\n\\nMy jaw grinding furiously, I stormed down the hall to the elevator. A  wife is the only thing stopping me now.\\n\\n“Please wait, hold the elevator.”\\n\\nI lifted my gaze from the stack of messages I was sorting through on my phone.\\n\\nMy annoyance at the intrusion dissolved as I allowed my gaze to sweep over the female hurrying towards me.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThe single word singed into my brain, reverberating like a sharp kick to some buried part of my soul. The word encompassed her and described her so perfectly, yet still left many questions I suddenly had unanswered, at the hollowed, sad look in her eyes.\\n\\nAll thoughts of my ex-wife vanished as I let my eyes rove over her body. She was casually dressed in a Rules Sweatshirt, wrinkled cargo pants, and high-lace-up boots.\\n\\nHer golden curls pulled in a loose ponytail made me wonder how she’d look like bed tousled and fresh from sex.\\n\\nSuddenly she reached for her camera.\\n\\nA Reporter.\\n\\nI inwardly cursed. The blonde. Just as I’d figured, they were nothing but trouble.\\n\\nStriding towards her, I reached out and jerked the camera from her hands, turned it around, and deleted the last series of digital photos.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nKimberly Scott’s P.O.V\\n\\nSavage and fierce.\\n\\nDevastatingly sexy.\\n\\nHis heated gaze slid over me, once, twice and it sent warning signals shooting down my spine. STAY AWAY!\\n\\nI snapped out of the sizzling pull as I stopped in front of the closing elevator.\\n\\nJoey Dakota.\\n\\nCEO of a multibillionaire cosmetic company and political candidate for the Liberal People’s Party.\\n\\nA hysterical bubble of laughter rose to my lips.\\n\\nHow atypical of wealthy people. Their wealth is never enough, they always wanted more.\\n\\nJoey Dakota is no different.\\n\\nAfter his incredulous Men Beauty Product picked up, surprisingly I dare say, he got the publicity he hungered for and decided to add more to his riches through politics—aka stealing from the public.\\n\\nIt was enough that his numerous scandals hung around him like a foul stench, he was popularly known as the celebrity playboy, notorious and termed as the ‘Serial heartbreaker.’\\n\\nHe had a face that belonged on the front cover of a magazine than the first page of a political newspaper.\\n\\nImpulsively, I reached for the camera slung around my neck and a three ‘clicking’ sound later, the man held the elevator and yanked the camera from my arms.\\n\\n“Hey!” I rush at him, “What do you think you’re doing? You can’t do that!”\\n\\nBut he was too far out of my reach, I stare at him wide-eyed as he deleted the pictures I took.\\n\\nThat could have fetched me a few bucks from the Cherie magazine.\\n\\nI bit back a snort as I imagined the cringe-worthy caption the Editor would have given the picture, probably, “HOT CEO AND MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, SEX-ON-LEGS POLITICAL ASPIRANT CAUGHT PLAYING WITH HIS DOODLY-DOODLE IN AN ELEVATOR.”\\n\\nIt was far from the truth but at least it would provide me with a basic dinner tomorrow.\\n\\nHe removed the card from the storage slot and handed it back to me.\\n\\n“Weren’t you taught not to take photos of strangers without their consent? F* reporters.” he clipped at me and I about lost it there. How dare he talk to me about manners? He was the greedy CEO venturing into politics to make more money without caring for the less privileged.\\n\\n“I’m not a reporter. And weren’t you taught how to be courteous to strangers?” I retorted, “I guess not. Your mother wasn’t there to teach you manners.”\\n\\nI watched his hand still over the elevator keypad. ’ I was famous for my lack of a brain-to-mouth filter.\\n\\nI quickly moved towards the elevator door but it slid close with a ‘Ding’ and I felt my heart plop into my belly.\\n\\nHe turned to face me, his face filled with a dark rage, “What did you just say?”\\n\\nHis voice could cut glass.\\n\\nCelebrity or not. I was alone in an elevator with this man, a powerful man capable of getting away with anything…maybe …. Murder?\\n\\n“Nothing,” I stammered, my cheeks growing hot as he stalked towards me.\\n\\nI slid back, inch by inch, till I felt my back press against the cold steel walls of the elevator. He towered over me—a good nine inches taller than my five feet three as he stood in front of me.\\n\\nA cry escaped my lungs as he raised his fist and I closed my eyes.\\n\\nThe slap never came.\\n\\nCracking my eyes open, I saw him watching me with an intense burning look in pacific green eyes, his curiosity piqued, “You thought I was going to hit you?” his voice was quiet. “Why?”\\n\\nI held still, a measured look slipping into my eyes.\\n\\nI stomped down the compelling urge to open up to this strange man and share my burden with him. I couldn’t tell him or anyone at all.\\n\\nI was confused by my reaction to him, although he was a jerk, he gave me a sense of security.\\n\\nI shivered as his fingers trailed down the side of my face, to my parted lips. His fingers left tingles along the places they grazed and I found myself leaning into his touch.\\n\\n“I would never hit a woman,” he mused softly, “I only broke the stupid storage card.”\\n\\n“YOU DID WHAT?” I pushed him away from me, the spell between us broken as I fell to my knees, scraping up what I can salvage from the fragments of the storage card.\\n\\nAngry tears filled my eyes as the reality of what he had just done sank into my mind.\\n\\nThat card, he broke, contained the only copies of the photo of a rare plant I.0 just edited a few days ago.\\n\\nAn image of a woman’s pain-filled eyes, begging for a peaceful exit flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt was my only hope in paying for my mother’s hospital bills.\\n\\nOne would think that as an award-winning photojournalist, I would never go hungry a day in my life but alas, they were wrong.\\n\\nLife had a way of throwing clogs in a smoothly running wheel.\\n\\nNeither of us expected the stage four breast cancer that took over my mother’s previously healthy body and all the commission I earned went into her chemo.\\n\\nShe got better last year but as they say, cancer never truly leaves. She tested positive for COVID a few months ago and during isolation, her cancer returned with a raging intensity.\\n\\nI rose to my feet with my fists balled tightly by my side. I was shaking from the amount of anger running through me.\\n\\nJust as I took a step toward him, the lights in the elevator went off and it stopped moving.\\n\\nMy knees jerked forward from the impact and we stumbled into each other.\\n\\nI felt his hot breath along my cheek and butterflies fluttered their tiny wings in my belly. I momentarily forgot my anger.\\n\\nHis arm was spun tightly around my waist to stop me from falling but I wish he let me fall. I wouldn’t be this trembling mess in his arms.\\n\\n“Hey, Hey…” He whispered into my hair, running his hand over my back, “Are you okay?”\\n\\nI could hear the blood passing through my ears—thump, thump, thump—and saw my chest moving under two layers of clothing.\\n\\nI fought the urge to cling to him and pushed him away, a slight flush spreading on my skin. I hated being weak in front of people.\\n\\n“Are you claustrophobic?” now that he wasn’t holding me, I could barely tell where he stood.\\n\\nI nodded a reply, even though I knew he couldn’t see me. I have been scared of dark and enclosed spaces since… I block the thoughts out as I stood up. The slight trembling that had started in my hands traveled down into my arms and legs, leaving me unsteady on my feet.\\n\\nI fell to the ground with a thump and I heard Joey Dakota curse.\\n\\nSuddenly, a small light flickered on and I felt his hand touch my arms, “You are having a panic attack Miss…” he trailed off and I croaked, “Kim... Call me Kim.”\\n\\n“I need you to focus on the sound of my voice,” His deep voice made every word he uttered seem charged with authority and I gave a small nod as my heart seem to pound even faster, even harder.\\n\\n“Breath Kim,” he murmured into my ears, concern radiating through him.\\n\\nI tried taking a deep breath to calm myself, but my breaths were sharp and shallow. The glare of the flashlight grew even dimmer and narrower.\\n\\n“You are dying.” A voice in my head said, “This was what death feels like and you are going to die alone.”\\n\\nAs if he heard my thoughts, he rubbed the side of my face, “You are not alone, I am with you. Breathe with me, Kim…Breath.”\\n\\nHis voice took on a soothing quality that pounded through my veins and I breathed with him, hypnotized by his calm, unhurried voice.\\n\\nMy palms were sweaty but not from my phobia. His closeness made me feel a blush spread across my skin.\\n\\nI felt his hand move around my back, pulling my sweatshirt off, “We are just going to take off your clothes to allow you to breathe easier.”\\n\\nMy breathing was getting better but I still felt disoriented so I gave a small nod.\\n\\nSoon I was in my purple bra alone with a stranger in a dark elevator while he placed a few phone calls. I couldn’t make any sense of the one-sided conversation.\\n\\nHe shoved his phone into his pocket and made his way towards me, where I shivered on the floor, “is it better now?”\\n\\n“Yes…thank you.” A red fiery blush splotched on my cheeks as he drew me into his arms to check my temperature.\\n\\nNow that my episode had passed, I was now very aware of the fact that I was scantily clad in my lilac lacy lingerie while Billionaire Dakota was fully dressed in a grey power suit that probably cost more than my entire mortgage. It didn’t matter if I still had my cargo pants on, every inch of my skin his fingers grazed came alive.\\n\\nSuddenly the lights flickered and with a small ding, the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\nMy eyes widened in alarm as I took in the lobby of the administrative building crowded with people milling about. I recognized one woman as a reporter on a local television program and by the glint in her eyes, she recognized me too. I felt Joey Dakota go rigid behind me as flashbulbs popped, blinding me.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nJoey’s P.O.V\\n\\nWhy the* did they come here?\\n\\nI jammed my fingers against the keypad, punching in a different floor number. Anything to get us away from the media.\\n\\nAs if they caught a whiff of what I was trying to do, most of them rushed towards the elevator, desperately crowding in and reaching tape recorders and cameras.\\n\\nThe doors finally slid close and I rested against the steel walls.\\n\\n*ing reporters. I could already imagine the headlines.\\n\\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Kim pulling on her sweatshirt, her face stricken. I wondered if she was alright. My jaw tightened as I recalled the panic I felt when she began hyperventilating. I hadn’t felt as useless as I felt in that instant, hating that she had to go through that while I muttered nonentities like a salty old fool.\\n\\nA ragged pant rose to my lips as I remembered how soft the flesh of her arms was when I helped her out of her shirt. The tingling I felt in my groin. I tore my eyes away from her as shame washed through me.\\n\\nI’m surprised the spit-fire hasn’t threatened to file a harassment lawsuit from how long I’ve been staring at her.\\n\\nThe elevator doors pinged.\\n\\nThe top floor was no different from the lobby. The party members and executives had their own knot of reporters to deal with.\\n\\nWaving her forward, we stepped out of the elevator and skirted the crowd by staying close to the wall. Kim’s hand grew sweaty and clammy in mine and I spared her a glance, “Don’t worry about what happened earlier, I would sure make every picture those leeches took of us not published.”\\n\\nShe shook her head, “Give me one reason I shouldn’t head back downstairs and tell the media what sort of brute you are!”\\n\\nTaken aback, I narrowed my eyes at her, “What?”\\n\\n“You destroyed my* storage card.” Her eyes shone, “It had everything in it. Everything!”\\n\\nShe enthralled me. No one has ever dared to yell at my face. Or counter my words. Kim was different, I knew that since I saw her walk into the elevator.\\n\\n“We are kind of in the middle of something,” I said with a hint of amusement and she was flustered.\\n\\nThankfully, the party executives finally slipped out at last. I watched Laurence weave his way through the crowd and headed toward the elevators. One reporter moved in on him but he held up his hand and waved her away. She stopped and moved back like a loose molecule to the bunch standing around Laura Gordon.\\n\\nLaurence finally saw me and hurried over to me.\\n\\n“What is going on here?” My voice was hard and reproachful as I gestured at the crowd, “You didn’t brief me that a conference might be held.”\\n\\n“Nah, that’s not me. One of the reporters says they had an anonymous tip that our administrative building caught fire and you were a victim.”\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nSomehow the reporters caught on that I was by the elevator and they rushed toward me.\\n\\nTheir voices yelled over each other.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Laurence stepped forward, “As you all can see, it was a false alarm and Mr. Dakota is safe and sound and there is no fire.” His voice towered over theirs and their yells trickled to a hushed whisper.\\n\\nI felt Kim clinging to my arm, as though she was trying to disappear behind me. A knot formed in my chest as I stared into her eyes. They said eyes were the window to the soul and hers reflected every emotion she felt. Right at this moment, it was filled with mortification.\\n\\nClearly, this wasn’t her scene and she hated the spotlight. It made me wonder who she was. No woman has ever sparked more than a fleeting glance from me since…I crushed the thought. I made a mental note to ask what was on the storage card I broke, it seemed to have sparked more than the usual passing anger.\\n\\n“Let me take it from here,” I said to Laurence and he shrugged, stepping aside.\\n\\nAll eyes riveted on me, “As Laurence had said, I am safe, if not sound,” there was a low chorus of laughter, “and there was no fire. If you have further questions, contact my assistant.”\\n\\n“Who is she?” Came from the throng.\\n\\nTightening my hold on Kim’s trembling fingers, I yanked her towards me and pushed through the screaming reporters till we were behind the safety of the doors to the empty conference room.\\n\\nRipping her hand from mine, Kim collapsed onto a chair, her hand making a knot at the hem of her sweatshirt, “I can’t imagine any sane person would willingly go through that every day.” Her voice was breathless.\\n\\nA smile tipped the side of my face, “It gets better with time.”\\n\\nShe snapped her head up and glared at me, “How does THAT get any better?” her eyes glinted, daring me to challenge her words.\\n\\nI walked past her to the water dispenser and grabbed two cups of water.\\n\\nI handed her one and took a sip from mine, “Because you get used to it.”\\n\\nShe gave an eye roll and muttered something under her breath.\\n\\nA hush enveloped us and that was when I noticed that the hallway was quiet, signifying that the reporters had finally left. Thank*g God.\\n\\nI just told a lie. Being hounded by the media was one thing a person never got used to.\\n\\nMy jaw flexed as I looked at my watch. I * missed the meeting.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door pushed open and my assistant, Laura walked in, face flushed.\\n\\nShe jolted as she saw me standing by the door, “Sir? I thought you left.”\\n\\nI shook my head, “The elevator broke down.”\\n\\nIt wouldn’t be the first time and no matter how much I demanded it from Laurence, he refused to have it fixed and rejected my offer to.\\n\\nShe nodded slowly in understanding.\\n\\n“You had a message from Carly sir. If I were you, I’d lose that one.” She glanced at a note in her hand.\\n\\nI scowled, staring down at my ex-wife’s name scribbled on the paper, “Anything important?\\n\\n“The usual. She said she just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.”\\n\\nI crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash can by the doorway. For some reason, the petite blond always seemed to forget that we were divorced.\\n\\nThen changing the topic, she pointed at the door, “They finally left. God, I wish they would just stop being such hounds.”\\n\\n“Yeah,” I murmured distractedly.\\n\\nI reached for the door handle but her eyes slightly widened as she looked over my shoulders, “Kimberly Scott?”\\n\\nI had momentarily forgotten that I wasn’t alone in the room when Laura walked in. I raised a brow in interest at Laura’s wide-eyed stare. I turned back to them.\\n\\n“Yeah…” Kim replied hesitantly, “That’s me.”\\n\\n“Oh my God,” Laura gushed, rushing towards her and I observed them both with my arms crossed, “I am your biggest fan. Oh my, I feel I just met a legend.”\\n\\nLegend? Who is Kimberly Scott? An actress maybe? I reflected with a sardonic twist of my lips, she sure could be one with her stunning face. Then I recalled she had a camera slung around her neck. Perhaps a photographer?\\n\\nA loud female giggle brought my mind to the conversation milling around me.\\n\\n“You must give me an autograph,” Laura bubbled, reaching for a small picture frame she had always carried around, “This is my favorite one from all the photos you have taken.”\\n\\nThe latter it is then.\\n\\nKim was red-faced and looked uncomfortable with the attention she was getting from Laura. It was as though she wished she was elsewhere.\\n\\nA few strands of hair fell over her brow and I had to physically restrain myself from walking over to tuck it behind her hair. I clenched my jaw, angry at the reaction she evoked from me. It was just lust, nothing else, I convinced myself, ‘I hadn’t been with a woman for a long time even if the media said the opposite.\\n\\nShe took the frame and scribbled something at the back and handed it back to Laura who took it with a giddy smile, “Thank you so much, Kim! Can I call you that?”\\n\\nShe nodded, somewhat embarrassed, “Of course, you can.”\\n\\nLaura abruptly whirled around, a red flush spreading over her face. She had probably forgotten I was still in the room, “Uh. Mr. Dakota, this is Kimberly Scott, an award-winning Photojournalist, and Kim, this is my boss, the CEO of Kota cosmetics, and the Political aspirant for the governorship seat.”\\n\\nShe was rambling and we all knew. She flushed even deeper as she realized that I had been in the room with Kim so I met her before.\\n\\nHelping her out of her misery, I cut in, “You never told me you were such a big shot,” I infused enough humor in my voice as I teased her.\\n\\nBut her eyes flashed fiercely and she turned a glare on me, “Yeah. Being an award-winning Photojournalist automatically makes me a ‘big shot.’ Live in the real world Mr. Dakota, not everyone gets every good thing life has to offer on a golden platter.”\\n\\nI didn’t hear a word she said.\\n\\nHer eyes. They enraptured me as she raved, “Do you know the color of your eyes turns to a dark grey when you are angry?” I muttered and her lips parted in a gasp.\\n\\nOur eyes held from across the room, hers a mix of infuriated and confused, mine hungry, heated.\\n\\nLaura immediately chipped in, “Kim, you haven’t published a photo since the last one. Why…?” she trailed off.\\n\\nKim shrugged, picking up the camera she placed on the conference table, “I have other things taking my time now.” Walking stiffly towards me, she spared me a cursory glance, “It was nice meeting you, Mr. Joey Dakota.”\\n\\n“My pleasure,” I took her hand in mine and pressed my lips to it. A smirk lifted the side of my lips as she yanked her hand away, as though it burned. I got my answer. Kim felt the exact thing I did, if not more.\\n\\nAt her exit, Laura sighed, “you must have done something terrible to make her so mad. Kimberly is termed by the media as ‘an angel.”\\n\\n“And what did the media term me as, “Devil?” I mused softly and she rolled her eyes, “They would be right if they did.”\\n\\nI snorted.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes lit up like the star on a Christmas tree as she stared at me.\\n\\n“What is it?” Narrowing my eyes, I asked, “I know that look, Laura.”\\n\\n“I think I might know what we have to do to get you a bride before the primaries.” Click to Read more about📜<AGAINST HER WILL>📜 www.readfreeapp.com'}, {'label': 0, 'text': '⚪️2023 State Election🔵⚪️\\n\\nI have the privilege to be the Liberal candidate for the Wagga Wagga Electorate for the upcoming state election. 🌾\\n\\nAs a Mother, Teacher, Small Business Woman, Councillor and Farmer I am motivated to run.

But before her hands could touch Michael Lucas, he pushed her away cruelly.\\n\"Don\\'t touch me!\" Michael\\'s cold voice was filled with contemptuous rejection.\\nWendy stumbled backward. Her collision with the edge of the table halted her momentum.\\nMichael approached her. He reached out, wrapping his hand around Wendy\\'s neck. With a dark smile, he asked, \"Do you agree to this divorce?\"\\nWendy found it difficult to talk when she was being strangled. She managed to choke out, \"I... do not.\"\\n\"You do not?\" Michael\\'s smile grew even colder as he tightened his grip around her neck.\\nFollowing that action, he pushed Wendy onto the table and informed her coldly, \"In that case, you have to fulfill your obligation to me as my wife ...\"\\nWendy gripped the edges of the table forcefully and could only passively put up with everything that was happening.\\nAfter some time, Michael finally decided to spare her.\\nHe walked over to the edge of the bed, pulled open the bedside drawer, and took out a pill. Tossing it onto Wendy\\'s body, he instructed her in his usual icy cold tone, \"Swallow it.\"\\nThe pill first landed on Wendy\\'s body before falling onto the ground.\\nShe gazed at the pill lying on the floor. Lowering her head, Wendy squatted down and picked it up slowly.\\nPicking up the pill, Wendy hesitated for a moment before putting it in her mouth.\\nMichael left after watching Wendy consume the pill.\\nWendy waited until Michael had completely disappeared from her vision before she spat out the pill in her mouth.\\nStaring at the tiny pill, Wendy laughed bitterly, and then she started to cry quietly.\\nShe had never dared to cry in front of Michael.\\nAfter all, Michael had once told her that he hated it when she cried, that he hated looking at her sad face.\\nThe following day, Wendy went to work at MC Enterprise on time as if nothing happened.\\nMC Enterprise was the biggest company in Lake City and Michael Lucas was the president there. Wendy happened to be his personal assistant.\\nMichael\\'s cold voice drifted to her ears the moment she entered the president\\'s office.\\nHe said, \"This is the third time that you are late this month. Your bonus salary has been completely deducted.\"\\nWendy bowed her head slightly and replied, \"In that case, you can dock my pay.\"\\nThe truth was that Wendy had not arrived late at all. This was just Michael looking for an excuse to deduct her pay.\\nWithout raising his head, Michael said, \"You can quit if you have any opinions about it.\"\\n\"I don\\'t have any opinions,\" replied Wendy as she blinked. \"Let me prepare some coffee for you.\"\\nAfter preparing the coffee, Wendy served it to Michael.\\nShe had just reached his office door when she heard Yvonne\\'s voice.\\nYvonne Taylor was the woman that Michael had loved for four years. Because of Yvonne, Wendy had been reduced to a cunning and unscrupulous woman in Michael\\'s eyes.\\nMichael had once warned Wendy that the only thing he could give her was a marriage certificate. The only reason she was able to join his company was because of pressure from his grandmother.\\nShe was instructed to avoid Yvonne whenever that woman appeared at the company. The consequence for not adhering to that was Wendy\\'s departure from MC Enterprise.\\nWendy was afraid to disobey.\\nJust as Wendy was about to head to the lounge to avoid Yvonne, she heard the latter say, \"Michael, you\\'ve finally agreed to let me join the company as your assistant. I\\'m overjoyed.\"\\nWendy heard Michael acknowledge those words.\\nThis made Wendy instantly stop in her tracks. Her hands, which were wrapped around the cup of coffee, started trembling.\\nWendy entered the office and grew agitated before Michael, which was a rare occurrence. \"I don\\'t approve of that!\" she said.\\nMichael shot Wendy a disgruntled look, replying in a cold voice, \"What right do you have to disagree?\"\\nWendy said, \"Michael, you promised me.\"\\n\"I did promise you, but it\\'s been three years. Some things should have changed a long time ago,\" replied Michael coldly. \"You don\\'t get any say in the company\\'s affairs.\"\\n\"Grandmother would never agree to it. Aren\\'t you afraid of angering her?\" For Wendy, Michael\\'s grandmother was the only bargaining chip she possessed.\\nWhen Michael heard those words, his face instantly darkened. \"Wendy Stewart, you keep dragging my grandmother into the picture. Haven\\'t you had enough? Let me warn you, don\\'t try to use my grandmother to pressure me. If you feel as though you can\\'t stay in this company, the HR department is on the fifth story.\"\\nThis was Michael\\'s ultimate weapon. No matter what happened, if Michael threatened her with divorce or resignation, Wendy found herself unable to do anything except grit her teeth and put up with it all.\\n***\\nNews of Yvonne Taylor\\'s new position of assistant to the president of MC Enterprise spread like wildfire throughout the company that very afternoon.\\nIt was well known within the company that Yvonne was Michael\\'s girlfriend.\\nInitially, Michael wanted to arrange for Yvonne to have a separate office. However, Yvonne claimed that she was coming here to work and said that it was best if they followed the company\\'s rules.\\nConsequently, it was only natural that Yvonne and Wendy started sharing the same office space.\\nYvonne approached Wendy with a smile. She said, \"Wendy Stewart, you resorted to despicable means to steal Michael from me three years ago and plotted to get married to him.\"\\n\"But how are things going for you now?\"\\n\"The entire company, no, in fact, everyone in Lake City knows that I am his real girlfriend.\"\\n\"If you\\'re smart, you should leave Michael of your own accord.\"\\n\"Otherwise, don\\'t blame me for being nasty.\"\\n\"This is the president\\'s work schedule for this week. I\\'ve already flagged out the important clients for you. Since you\\'re now his assistant, you should do what you need to do.\" Wendy handed Yvonne a document and continued, \"The first thing you should do upon arriving at the company every morning is to make a cup of coffee for the president. President Lucas likes his coffee without sugar, and you have to personally grind the coffee beans ...\"\\nWendy had not finished speaking when Yvonne slapped away the document she was holding. Yvonne retracted her smile.\\nHer voice filled with hatred as she said, \"Why are you so shameless? Michael does not love you at all, but you insist on clinging to him. Do you know that Michael always tells me how disgusted he feels when he sees you? I really don\\'t know how your parents raised you. You are just a vixen who specializes in stealing other people\\'s boyfriends!\"\\n\"Yvonne Taylor!\" Wendy stood up abruptly, slamming her hand heavily against the table. \"We both know very well exactly what happened three years ago.\"\\n\"So what if we know very well?\" Yvonne sneered. \"I\\'m sure you\\'ve tried to explain yourself to Michael many times over the past three years. If he wanted to believe you, it would have worked long ago.\"\\n\"Stop daydreaming! I am the person Michael loves. In his heart, you are just a vicious woman. See, I wanted to join the company and all had to do was tell him about it. He let me come to work the following day. You should know better than anyone where I stand in his heart. If you are smart, you should leave before it\\'s too late. Otherwise, I\\'ll make sure you meet with a horrible end!\"\\n\"Is that so? In that case, let\\'s just wait and see what happens,\" replied Wendy. She had endured everything for the past three years without getting divorced, there was no way that she would just back off just because Yvonne joined the company.\\nSuddenly, Yvonne shrieked and fell to the ground. Her tone immediately grew indignant as she said, \"Miss Stewart, I know you don\\'t like me and you never wanted me to join the company. However, all I wanted to do was stay by Michael\\'s side and help him alleviate some of his work problems ... I know you guys are married and I should not be doing this. But your marriage was a mistake in the first place, it was you who ... who ...\" Yvonne burst into tears.\\nWendy did not have to turn back to guess that Michael had probably stepped into the room.\\nIndeed, Michael took big strides forward. He squatted to help Yvonne up. His face was filled with anger as he gazed at Wendy. \"You should know that there is a limit to my tolerance.\"\\n\"Michael, please don\\'t blame Miss Stewart. She just wanted to chase me away. She doesn\\'t want me here,\" said Yvonne as she leaned heavily on Michael as if she had no backbone and was incapable of standing on her own.\\nWendy clenched her fists hidden beneath her sleeves.\\n\"There is a CCTV in this office. You can look at the footage to see for yourself what really happened earlier.\"\\nWendy knew Michael would never believe her words. The CCTV footage was the only way to let Michael learn about the truth.\\nUpon hearing those words, Yvonne\\'s eyes flashed, and she started crying harder.\\n\"Michael, I just wanted to work peacefully with Miss Stewart. After all, we are both your assistants. All I did was ask her about some work-related questions and requested for her guidance ... However, instead of helping me, she slapped my face with a document, and even pushed me ...\"\\nYvonne\\'s crying had reached its peak.\\nMichael comforted her while lecturing Wendy, \"If you dare bully Yvonne again, I\\'ll sure to teach you a lesson that even grandmother cannot interfere in.\"\\n\"Haha ...\" Wendy chuckled bitterly.\\nIndeed, Michael did not even want to check the CCTV footage.\\nHe believed everything Yvonne said.\\nChapter 2: Wake Up! Michael Doesn\\'t Love You\\nYvonne joined the company as Michael\\'s personal assistant but she had no actual responsibilities. All she did every day was wandering around the company, win over the hearts of her colleagues, and when it was time, have lunch with Michael.\\nJust as Michael had told her, all Yvonne had to do was look as pretty as a flower.\\nOf course, Yvonne also plotted to get Wendy in trouble.\\nThe only thing Wendy could do was put up with it.\\nIn the afternoon, Michael personally entered their office.\\n\"Michael.\" Upon seeing Michael, Yvonne instantly greeted him with a smile. \"Are you done with your meeting?\"\\n\"Yes, I am. I\\'m here to have lunch with you,\" Michael replied with a smile on his face. His arm wrapped around Yvonne\\'s waist smoothly. He completely ignored Wendy\\'s existence and led Yvonne past her, exiting the room.\\nWendy\\'s gaze trailed after their interlocked hands, her eyes unblinking.\\nNobody knew just how much misery she felt in her heart whenever Michael and Yvonne put up such a public display of affection in front of her.\\nWendy clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her skin. However, she felt nothing but numbness.\\nInhaling a deep breath, Wendy regulated her own emotions. She comforted herself quietly. After all, this was not the first time. What was the point of getting angry now?\\nShe thought, \\'if I cannot even put up with this, how can I continue working in this company?\\'\\nAs Wendy lowered her head to arrange the documents on the table, she caught sight of fresh blood dripping from her palms. Almost mechanically, she grabbed a piece of tissue to clean her wounds.\\nNot long after, Zen Tanner entered the office. He said, \"Wendy, I just found out that President Lucas deducted money from your salary again. Why didn\\'t you tell me that you have no money to eat? Come on, let\\'s go get some food.\"\\n\"I\\'m not hungry, and anyway, I\\'m trying to lose weight. I don\\'t want to eat. You can go ahead,\" said Wendy. The truth was, she was afraid of running into Yvonne and Michael at the cafeteria in the third story.\\n\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'re not hungry again. You haven\\'t been eating lunch for the past few days, have you? Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'ll end up starving your body? If that really happens, you\\'ll just be letting Yvonne win.\" Zen paid no attention to Wendy\\'s rejection. He grabbed her and walked out of the office.\\nWendy had no appetite, to begin with. However, Zen was right. She thought, \\'if l really fall sick from starving myself, I would be letting Yvonne win.\\'\\nShe followed Zen to the third story.\\nHalfway through their meal, Michael and Yvonne walked out of the private room.\\nWendy heard the people around her express their envy, but she did not have the courage to look up at the couple.\\nWhen Yvonne saw Wendy, her eyes flashed.\\nReleasing her grip on Michael, she approached Wendy with a smile. Yvonne took out a bracelet from her purse and handed it to her, saying, \"Miss Stewart, I have a gift for you ... I wanted to give this to you previously as well, but you refused to accept it. This time, I hope that you will accept it in front of everybody. In the future, let\\'s work hard together and help Michael, okay?\"\\nYvonne had never tried to give Wendy any gifts. Her words were only meant for the people around them to hear, to highlight her generosity and Wendy\\'s pettiness.\\n\"I don\\'t need it,\" Wendy rejected her coldly.\\nShe thought, \\'why would I possibly accept anything from Yvonne?\\'\\nWhen she looked up, she saw delight swimming in Yvonne\\'s eyes.\\nIndeed, everyone around them was talking about her.\\nSomeone said, \"Wendy Stewart really doesn\\'t know where she stands.\"\\nAnother person added, \"How dare she act so arrogant when Miss Taylor is personally offering her a gift?\"\\n\"Miss Taylor is the president\\'s real girlfriend. Where does Wendy get her guts from? really respect her.\"\\n\"Indeed, the whole company knows what she\\'s up to. I really don\\'t know how such a shameless woman can exist in this world.\"\\n\"I heard that Wendy Stewart threatened Yvonne Taylor on her first day here. I really don\\'t know where she got the courage to act like that.\"\\n....\\n\"Miss Stewart, are you saying you don\\'t want to work harmoniously with me?\"\\nYvonne\\'s tone quickly turned indignant. She continued, \"I know that you detest me, but I just want to do my job well.\"\\nWendy thought, \\'she wants to do her job well?\\'\\nShe wanted to laugh.\\nHas Yvonne even done anything at all over the past few days?\\nYvonne schemed endlessly to enter the company, all because she wanted to always remain at Michael\\'s side.\\nJust like ... Wendy herself.\\nWendy did not have a good reputation in the company. She did not care and could not be bothered to explain herself.\\nLowering her head, Wendy continued eating the rice in her bowl.\\nZen could not continue watching this. He stood up. But before he could say anything, he was held back by Wendy. \"It\\'s not necessary,\" she said.\\nWendy knew that Zen was doing this for her good.\\nHowever, she worked at MC Enterprise where Michael was the president of the company. On top of that, Yvonne had gotten a job as his assistant. If Zen tried to stand up for Wendy right now, even if he did not get fired immediately, he would have a hard time in the company.\\nAs Michael observed Wendy\\'s indifference, anger rose in his chest.\\nHe thought that this woman really did not know any better.\\nMichael stepped forward. He took the bracelet on the table and turned around, pulling Yvonne with him. In a cold voice, he said, \"She\\'s not worthy of such an expensive gift.\"\\nYvonne turned her head to glance at Wendy and made sure she was loud enough to be overheard by the latter when she spoke, \"I know I shouldn\\'t give away the bracelet that you bought for me, Michael, but I really had nothing but good intentions. I just want to remain in the company and be able to stay by your side.\"\\nHold on ...\\nWendy thought, \\'that bracelet was a gift from Michael?\\'\\nWendy inhaled deeply.\\nIn the past three years of their marriage, Michael had never given her anything-not even a flower petal, much less a bracelet.\\nToday, however, Yvonne was about to give her a bracelet that Michael had bought for her.\\nShe knew Yvonne did it on purpose.\\nWendy did not hear a single word of Michael\\'s subsequent response.\\n\"Wendy, your palms are bleeding!\" Zen called Wendy\\'s name several times but he failed to get her to return to her senses.\\nSeeing that she was injured, Zen quickly unfurled her fists and saw blood dripping from her palms.\\nThe wounds were a result of Wendy\\'s nails digging deep into her flesh.\\nWendy came to her senses and immediately retracted her hands. \"Let\\'s get back to work now that we\\'ve finished our meal.\" With that, Wendy stood up and left.\\nFeeling worried about Wendy, Zen quickly trailed after her. \"Wendy, please don\\'t scare me. You\\'re bleeding so much. Let me go back to the office with you and bandage your wounds,\" he said.\\n\"I\\'m fine, just ignore me,\" said Wendy. She had long grown numb to the pain.\\n\"How can you possibly be fine?\" asked Zen. \"I know that you\\'re upset, you can cry or talk to me, but please don\\'t suppress your emotions.\"\\n\"I\\'m really fine,\" Wendy repeated.\\nLooking at Wendy\\'s soulless appearance, Zen felt worried and angry at the same time.\\nSensing no intention on Wendy\\'s part to stop walking, Zen shouted loudly, \"Wendy Stewart!\"\\nThe sudden loudness of his voice made Wendy stop in her tracks momentarily. Zen sneered at her from behind. \"Can you take a look at what you\\'ve turned into? ... In the past three years, you have grown submissive and relenting.\"\\n\"You used to be high-spirited, proud, and confident. You were the most attractive girl in our school. Half of the male student population wanted to woo you. You were also the most outstanding student in our school-you was praised by the teachers and were a role model for the other students. Back then, you said that you wanted to become the brightest star in the design industry. You wanted to stand on the international stage and shine radiantly ... You were clearly the bright moon, but for a man like this, you turned into a grain of dust.\"\\n\"You gave up on design, gave up on your dreams, and instead chose to stay beside Michael, making coffee for him every day!\"\\n\"Wendy Stewart, when will you wake up? Michael doesn\\'t love you, why do you devalue yourself like this?\"\\nChapter 3: Something Felt Fishy\\nZen\\'s words replayed in Wendy\\'s mind.\\nIndeed, Michael did not love her.\\nHowever, the first time she laid eyes on Michael, she had already lost herself. How could she possibly let go of three years of obsession?\\nWhen she returned to the office, Wendy witnessed Yvonne feeding Michael some sliced fruits. The smiles on their faces made her eyes sting.\\nThey could have gone to the president\\'s office to behave intimately, yet they deliberately chose to remain in the assistant\\'s office.\\nMore blood trickled down Wendy\\'s palms, hidden beneath her sleeves.\\nWhen Yvonne saw Wendy coming in, she said with a smile, \"Miss Stewart, it\\'s currently still lunchtime. Michael and intend to rest on the couch, why don\\'t you go hang out in the lounge for a while?\"\\n\"This is my office,\" said Wendy and she remained where she was without moving.\\nYvonne was obviously the guest in this office, yet she continued acting as though she owned the space.\\nYvonne grabbed Michael\\'s hand and started whining unhappily, \"Michael.\"\\nMichael lifted his head. He regarded Wendy with raised eyebrows, his face displeased. \"I own this entire company, you have to go wherever I tell you to go. If you don\\'t wish to work here anymore ...\"\\nBefore Michael could finish speaking, Wendy finally lost her temper. She said, \"Michael, is this the only thing you can threaten me with? Back then, you promised me that I could join the company and that you would not fire me if I did not leave voluntarily. In exchange, I would not appear before you and Yvonne whenever she came to the company. Now that she is working here as your assistant, I want you to agree to another condition.\"\\n\"Wendy Stewart, when did you become so obstinate?\" Michael could not help giving Wendy another glance as he observed the anger on her face.\\nHe thought, \\'this woman has never dared to disobey me. Now, she\\'s negotiating with me?\\'\\n\"I know you detest me and l cannot do anything about you wanting to bring Yvonne into the company. However, both of you are forbidden from public displays of affection before me. Otherwise, I will ...\"\\nBefore Wendy could finish speaking, Michael snorted. \"Otherwise? You\\'re probably just going to complain to my grandmother.\"\\n\"You\\'re absolutely right,\" said Wendy. At those words, she whipped out her mobile phone and stared directly at Michael. \"If you don\\'t agree to my condition, I\\'ll call your grandmother right now and tell her that you gave Yvonne a job in the company.\"\\nMichael gazed at Wendy\\'s hands and frowned lightly, feeling surprised about her injury.\\nHowever, he felt nothing but disgust and hatred toward Wendy. Naturally, he did not care that she was hurt.\\n\"Michael ...\" Yvonne was afraid that Michael would agree just like that. She said coquettishly, \"I just want to hang out with you for a little longer.\"\\nThe atmosphere had grown really tense.\\nAll three individuals in the office were silent. The entire space was alarmingly quiet.\\nThis was the first time that Wendy was negotiating with Michael so bravely.\\nAs his wife, her condition was for them to stop behaving intimately before her eyes. However, she was terrified. She was afraid that Michael would chase her out of the company in a moment of anger and insist on getting divorced.\\nWendy felt that she was pitiful and pathetic at the same time.\\nAfter some time, Michael stood up and left the office.\\nMichael\\'s lack of an outburst allowed Wendy to heave a sigh of relief.\\n\"Wendy Stewart, don\\'t presume that Michael\\'s departure means that he has agreed to your condition,\" said Yvonne with a smile. \"You can threaten him with his grandmother for now, but I don\\'t believe you can do that for the rest of your life. Just wait and see, I\\'ll make sure Michael kicks you out of this company.\"\\nWendy paid no attention to Yvonne. She returned to her own desk and lowered her head, immersing herself in her work.\\nShe knew she could not beat Yvonne.\\nEven though she was reluctant to admit it, Michael\\'s heart did indeed belong to Yvonne.\\n***\\nIn the following days, Yvonne and Michael still walked around the company around together. However, they never lingered at the assistant\\'s office again.\\nWendy knew that they continued their intimate behavior in places she could not see.\\nSighing softly, she sorted out the documents on her desk and went to deliver them to Michael.\\nAt that moment, Mr. York happened to be reporting to Michael about his work schedule for the rest of the day, \"In half an hour, you have a meeting with Mr. Collins about your collaboration. Your meeting location has been fixed at Hotel J. Miss Zendaya is the secretary assigned to this project. It takes about fifteen minutes to get there, so you should get ready to leave now.\"\\nYvonne had been sitting by the side using her mobile phone. When she spotted Wendy entering the room, her gaze changed. She rose and walked over to Michael, saying, \"Let me go with you. I want to make use of this opportunity to learn how I can help you with your work, Michael.\"\\n\"About that,\" said Mr. York, \"Miss Taylor, you have no experience in these matters. Why don\\'t you wait until you\\'re more familiar with the workflow?\"\\nMr. York was Michael\\'s best assistant. He had been with Michael for five years and he had always been a hard and conscientious worker.\\nAt the same time, he was also someone who could separate work and personal matters very well.\\n\"Won\\'t you and Michael be there as well? I just want to follow you along so I can gain some experience. I promise I won\\'t be a hindrance,\" said Yvonne. The truth was that Yvonne was not a hardworking person, she merely wanted to agitate Wendy.\\n\"Let her come along if she wants to. After all, the discussion is almost finished,\" Michael said before he turned to Yvonne and continued, \"Go look for Miss Zendaya and have her hand over the documents to you.\"\\n\"Thank you, Michael,\" said Yvonne. She set off to look for Miss Zendaya happily, but before she left, she raised her eyebrows at Wendy triumphantly.\\nMr. York stared at Yvonne\\'s retreating back, looking rather displeased.\\nHe tried to persuade Michael, \"Mr. Lucas, you shouldn\\'t allow Miss Taylor to have her way like that. It doesn\\'t matter what you do in your private time, but it\\'s better to set boundaries in work-related affairs.\"\\nMichael raised his head unhappily. He retorted, \"Are you letting how much I pay you get to your head?\"\\nMr. York knew that there was nothing he could say that would be effective. Hence, he made no further comment.\\nAfter they left the office, Wendy packed up his work area.\\nShe had just returned to her own office when the phone on her desk started ringing.\\n\"Good afternoon, this is the assistant\\'s office of MC Enterprise ...\"\\nBefore Wendy could finish speaking, Yvonne\\'s voice was heard over the phone, \"Miss Stewart, we forgot to bring one of the documents.

And I did.\\n\\nKnowing what I know now, everything I experienced over the years was in an effort to wake me up. Learning how to heal my own body because the US government’s foundation of learning for doctors in this country leaves out a key method to healing, for example. This was just one point of awareness over the course of a lifetime. Or maybe how an old friend of mine used to work at Wells Fargo and I was a victim of their account scheme back in the day when she worked there. This wasn’t aware to me until I saw Dirty Money, we are no longer friends. The list is endless. \\n\\nSo here I find myself in Kansas City, MO. A notoriously deep Red state with some deep problems that have lead me to become a full-blown activist. Grant and I have had to become actual crime fighters, just two weeks ago chasing down a thief that made off with some woman’s bag in broad daylight. After having been mugged and assaulted in New York, this was a win that we got her bag back! Scooter Gang to the Rescue!! \\n\\nOn a serious note, my first step in the state healthcare issue is getting the federal government involved because Missouri is breaking federal laws. The wealthy population thrives here while the financial divide grows so wide, it can only be compared to that of a science fiction film.

The Australian is distributed nationally and has a very wide reach. \\n\\nRobert's article appears prominently on the Australian newspaper website and has attracted a significant response in the comments section. \\n\\nAJA has been the leading Jewish organisation in Australia in calling out the oppression of the Uighur people by the Chinese Communist party. This has not been without consequences. \\n\\nAJA takes the lesson of 'never Again' from the Holocaust very seriously. \\n\\nWhile we will never waiver from our core mission of advocating for the Australian Jewish Community and Israel, which occupies 99.9% of our time, we are proud to provide a voice to those who don't have the same access that we do. \\n\\nRead the article online or below: \\n\\nhttps://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/as-a-jew-i-cant-stay-silent-on-persecution-of-chinas-muslims/news-story/0a6aafc2fb79513fc80449fba529a7ee\\n\\nAS A JEW, I CAN'T STAY SILENT ON PERSECUTION OF CHINA'S MUSLIMS \\n\\nAs a Jew, I cannot stay silent while Muslims face the religious persecution my people know so well.\\n\\nAs analysts and policy wonks debate the recent “tremendous reset” between Anthony Albanese and Chinese president for life Xi Jinping and the meaning of Penny Wong’s recent trip to Beijing, an important question is ignored. Are closer China relations something Australia should aspire to at this time?\\n\\nMany experts assert that China is committing genocide against its Uighur Muslim population. More than one million Uighurs are held in re-education camps, including young children separated from their parents. The detainees are forcibly indoctrinated with Chinese Communist Party propaganda and forbidden from speaking their language.\\n\\nUighur women claim they are forced to have abortions and undergo sterilisation. Statistics show that in 2014, Xinjiang – the province where Uighurs live – accounted for 2.5 per cent of intra-uterine device placements. Just four years later that had skyrocketed to 80 per cent of China’s IUD placements. (Xinjiang makes up 1.8 per cent of China’s population.)\\n\\nI recently attended a beautiful Uighur wedding. The groom’s parents were unable to attend because China wouldn’t let them leave. Several guests told heart-wrenching stories. One man told me that the last time he spoke to his mother, she asked him not to phone again as phone calls with the West could get her detained. That was in 2017 and he hadn’t heard from her since. Another young man said that when his wife returned to China for a visit, she was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for studying overseas. She was pregnant with his unborn child.\\n\\nGrowing up in the shadow of the Holocaust, with a grandmother who survived Auschwitz, I have always resisted conflating the Holocaust. Holocaust comparisons are generally inaccurate and don’t help further one’s case. The Holocaust stands alone in its calculated brutality. The project to annihilate an entire race was devised in “enlightened” Germany and assisted by willing collaborators spanning the breadth of Europe.\\n\\nThat said, certain parallels are hard to overlook. Tonnes of shaved Uighur hair for sale, concentration camps, systematic destruction of places of worship, allegations of medical experimentation, slave labour and bans on religious Muslims growing beards all evoke aspects of humanity’s darkest hour.\\n\\nThe Holocaust bestowed Jews with a special responsibility to speak out on behalf of those facing religious and racial persecution. The Australian Jewish Association has hosted Uighur speakers, addressed Uighur rallies, made submissions to government and worked to raise awareness. Overseas, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has sounded the alarm, warning the “Chinese government may be committing genocide against the Uighurs”. The American Jewish Committee has urged President Joe Biden to take action.\\n\\nI’m not naive. I know there isn’t a single country without human rights concerns. Even Western nations have their issues. Obviously, Australia can’t cut itself off from every country engaged in human rights abuses, but there is a line – it’s just a matter of where it’s drawn.\\n\\nThis year the West drew that line at invading a neighbouring European country. Russia has been made a pariah and rightfully so. Our Prime Minister almost certainly would decline a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Likewise, Australian business leaders would run a mile. In fact, Australian companies have severed all business connections with Russia.\\n\\nIn contrast, Australia’s desire not to rock the boat with China has caused embarrassing scenes. A Uighur delegation, including concentration camp survivors who reported experiencing torture and forced sterilisation, vis\\xadited Canberra recently and were declined a meeting with Wong.\\n\\nSo why the discrepancy? Our business ties with Russia were minuscule. Severing them imposed no real cost to Australia.\\n\\nWere Australia to take meaningful steps against China, the economic fallout has the potential to plunge us into recession. China has shown it’s not averse to using economic blackmail to bully Australia. There was talk last year about banning goods produced by Uighur slave labour, a seeming no-brainer, but the bill never passed. Instead, Australia’s trade with China’s Uighur province has increased including solar panels and cotton.\\n\\nTo be fair, Australia has spoken out at the UN. Shamefully, China sits on the UN Human Rights Council and has stymied all action.\\n\\nI don’t pretend to have the answers but I know Australia can’t carry on like “business as usual”. The line must be drawn somewhere. If it isn’t Tibet, Taiwan or Hong Kong, then surely concentration camps and allegations of organ harvesting cross Australia’s line. Decoupling our economy from China has been spoken about in a national security context and banning goods produced by slave labour seems like a good place to start. Recognising China’s actions as genocide is another.\\n\\nI can’t predict what the Foreign Minister’s China visit means for Sino-Australian ties, but one thing is clear to me. As a Jew, I will continue to speak out for Uighur Muslims. I can’t stay silent.\\n\\nRobert Gregory is director of public affairs at the Australian Jewish Association.\"}, {'label': 0, 'text': \"I'm Wayne and I'm standing as the Liberal candidate for Narracan.\\n\\nWorking together, we can address the critical issues facing our rural and regional communities.\\n\\nWith your support, I'll stand up for our region and be your voice for in the Victorian Parliament.
